        "text": "Abstract \n \nCarbonate margin and slope systems exhibit massive scale gravity failures controlling the export of large quantities of carbonate production \nfrom the shelf and slope to deep parts of the basin. Understanding the triggering of these events, and integrating their occurrence into the \nstratigraphic evolution of a carbonate system is decisive for prospect evaluation at the basin scale. Gravity-driven mass transport can induce \nand control the location of calciclastic reservoir facies. \n \nGravity failures are mechanical destabilizations of sediment accumulated in a stable configuration, but influenced by pre-conditioning \nmechanisms (e.g. over steepening, fluid overpressure build-up by overloading, or fluid flow) that induce failure during a triggering event (e.g. \nseismic ground acceleration, cyclic loading, fluid escape). This contribution shows the integrated investigation of this genetic chain at each \ntime step of system evolution using forward stratigraphic and basin numerical modeling tools. \n \nThe first step is a forward stratigraphic modeling using DionisosFlow software in order to determine the geometrical and facies evolution \nthrough time. The second step is the computation of the mechanical stratigraphy that is the time-dependent state of sediments density and \nassociated mechanical load, fluid pressure and resulting stress state. It is determined with IFPEN basin modeling tools used for hydro-\nmechanical calculations. The third step is the computation with a limit analysis approach of the most probable failure geometry and associated \nload factor, using the OptumG2 software (U. Newcastle, Aus). \n \nThis innovative workflow is applied on 2D sections of the well-described Plio-Quaternary Western and Eastern slopes of the Great Bahama \nBank. They exhibit recurrent and various types of mass failure events. The simulations are carried out using mechanical characterization of the",
