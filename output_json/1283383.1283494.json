In the popular\nk-means formulation, one is given an integer k and a set\nof n data points in Rd. The goal is to choose k centers\nso as to minimize φ, the sum of the squared distances\nbetween each point and its closest center.\nSolving this problem exactly is NP-hard, even with\njust two clusters [10], but twenty-ﬁve years ago, Lloyd\n[20] proposed a local search solution that is still very\nwidely used today (see for example [1, 11, 15]). Indeed,\na recent survey of data mining techniques states that it\n“is by far the most popular clustering algorithm used in\nscientiﬁc and industrial applications” [5].\nUsually referred to simply as k-means, Lloyd’s\nalgorithm begins with k arbitrary centers, typically\nchosen uniformly at random from the data points. Each\npoint is then assigned to the nearest center, and each\ncenter is recomputed as the center of mass of all points\nassigned to it. These two steps (assignment and center\ncalculation) are repeated until the process stabilizes.\nOne can check that the total error φ is monotoni-\ncally decreasing, which ensures that no clustering is re-\npeated during the course of the algorithm. Since there\nare at most kn possible clusterings, the process will al-\nways terminate. In practice, very few iterations are usu-\nally required, which makes the algorithm much faster",

        "text": "despite its limited accuracy. The convergence time of\nLloyd’s method has been the subject of a recent series\nof papers [2, 4, 8, 14]; in this work we focus on improving\nits accuracy.\nIn the theory community, Inaba et al. [16] were\nthe ﬁrst to give an exact algorithm for the k-means\nproblem, with the running time of O(nkd). Since then, a\nnumber of polynomial time approximation schemes have\nbeen developed (see [9, 13, 19, 21] and the references\ntherein). While the authors develop interesting insights\ninto the structure of the clustering problem, their\nalgorithms are highly exponential (or worse) in k, and\nare unfortunately impractical even for relatively small\nn, k and d.\nKanungo et al. [17] proposed an O(n3ϵ−d) algorithm\nthat is (9 + ϵ)-competitive.\nHowever, n3 compares\nunfavorably with the almost linear running time of\nLloyd’s method, and the exponential dependence on d\ncan also be problematic. For these reasons, Kanungo et\nal. also suggested a way of combining their techniques\nwith Lloyd’s algorithm, but in order to avoid the\nexponential dependence on d, their approach sacriﬁces\nall approximation guarantees.\nMettu and Plaxton [22] also achieved a constant-\nprobability O(1) approximation using a technique called\nsuccessive sampling. They match our running time of\nO(nkd), but only if k is suﬃciently large and the spread\nis suﬃciently small. In practice, our approach is simpler,\nand our experimental results seem to be better in terms\nof both speed and accuracy.\nVery recently, Ostrovsky et al. [24] independently\nproposed an algorithm that is essentially identical to\nours, although their analysis is quite diﬀerent. Letting\nφOPT,k denote the optimal potential for a k-clustering\non a given data set, they prove k-means++ is O(1)-\ncompetitive in the case where\nφOPT,k\nφOPT,k−1\n≤ϵ2.\nThe\nintuition here is that if this condition does not hold,\nthen the data is not well suited for clustering with the\ngiven value for k.\nCombining this result with ours gives a strong\ncharacterization of the algorithm’s performance.\nIn\nparticular, k-means++ is never worse than O(log k)-\ncompetitive, and on very well formed data sets, it\nimproves to being O(1)-competitive.\nOverall, the seeding technique we propose is similar\nin spirit to that used by Meyerson [23] for online facility\nlocation, and Mishra et al. [12] and Charikar et al. [6]\nin the context of k-median clustering.\nHowever, our\nanalysis is quite diﬀerent from those works.",

The D2 seeding is slightly\nslower than uniform seeding, but it still leads to a faster\nalgorithm since it helps the local search converge after\nfewer iterations.\nThe synthetic example is a case where standard\nk-means does very badly.\nEven though there is an\n“obvious” clustering, the uniform seeding will inevitably\nmerge some of these clusters, and the local search will\nnever be able to split them apart (see [12] for further\ndiscussion of this phenomenon).\nThe careful seeding\nmethod of k-means++ avoided this problem altogether,\nand it almost always attained the optimal clustering on\nthe synthetic dataset.\nThe diﬀerence between k-means and k-means++\non the real-world datasets was also substantial.\nIn\nevery case, k-means++ achieved at least a 10% accuracy\nimprovement over k-means, and it often performed\nmuch better.\nIndeed, on the Spam and Intrusion\ndatasets, k-means++ achieved potentials 20 to 1000\ntimes smaller than those achieved by standard k-means.\nEach trial also completed two to three times faster, and\neach individual trial was much more likely to achieve a\ngood clustering.",

Most\nimportantly, it is standard practice to run the k-means\nalgorithm multiple times, and then keep only the best\nclustering found. This raises the question of whether",
