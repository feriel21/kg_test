The evolution of seismic acquisition and\nprocessing capabilities has made it possible to acquire ever-growing amounts of data,\nincreasing the image resolution so that sedimentary objects (geobodies) can be imaged\nwith greater precision within sedimentary layers. However, exploring and interpreting\nthem in large datasets can be tedious work. Recent practice has shown the poten-\ntial of automated methods to assist interpreters in this task. In this paper, a new\nsemi-supervised methodology is presented for identifying multi-facies geobodies in\nthree-dimensional seismic data, while preserving their internal facies variability and\nkeeping track of the input uncertainty. The approach couples a nonlinear data-driven\nmethod with a novel supervised learning method. It requires a prior delineation of\nthe geobodies on a few seismic images, along with a priori conﬁdence in that delin-\neation. The methodology relies on a learning of an appropriate data representation,\nand propagates the prior conﬁdence to posterior probabilities attached to the ﬁnal\ndelineation. The proposed methodology was applied to three-dimensional real data,\nshowing consistently effective retrieval of the targeted multi-facies geobodies mass-\ntransport deposits in the present case.",

        "text": "In three-dimensional seismic data interpretation, the detection of geobodies such as\nsalt bodies, channels or mass-transport deposits can prove critical in assessing the\nreservoir potential of a region or basin, or in gaining a better understanding of a\ngeological structure. Characterization of their various features on seismic amplitude\ndatais alsoneeded, toproperlydescribethevariabilityinsuchgeobodies andtoprovide\nclues for interpreting their diversity (e.g. Ogiesoba and Hammes 2012). In this respect,\ngeobody detection and characterization is one task that remains challenging.\nSeismic interpretation methods still require a relatively high level of expert guid-\nance, due to the complex aspects of the amplitude data themselves, particularly\nthe inherent intricacy of all scales of geological structures that appear on the data.\nDepending on which scale is chosen (horizon delineation for stratigraphic interpreta-\ntion/object delineation/intra-object variations), the outlined structure is not the same,\nmainly because what is looked for is deﬁned by the interpretation objective. Once the\nobjective is ﬁxed, dedicated automated methods can be implemented to limit manual\ntime-consuming tasks.\nIn seismic interpretation, a seismic facies is an identiﬁed local aspect of the seis-\nmic image, deﬁned by the spatial organization of reﬂectors in a zone. “Seismic\nattributes” have long been employed as an analytical tool (Haralick et al. 1973), espe-\ncially for depicting seismic facies. They can be used similarly as data “features” in\nmachine learning vocabulary. In particular, a seismic image can be dealt with as a\ntextured image, where each pixel (or three-dimensional “voxel”) is described by the\narrangement of amplitude values in its neighborhood. Textural features characterize\nthe local distribution of intensities around each pixel. When computed on seismic\namplitudes, they have been shown to effectively describe the variety of pattern sizes\nand orientations present in seismic datasets (e.g. Long et al. 2015). They provide a\nmostly data-driven representation, contrary to representations based on “engineered”\nattributes such as acoustic impedance, which, although giving more physical insights\non rock properties, require more model-driven computation steps. A textural represen-\ntation of the seismic data at several scales is appropriate for depicting seismic facies,\ngiven the structurally mixed sizes of seismic patterns.\nAutomated approaches for local interpretation in seismic datasets mainly concern\ngeobody delineation and facies classiﬁcation. The former use object-based approaches\nin image processing, focusing either on the object contours (e.g. Wang et al. 2015,\n2016; Shaﬁq et al. 2015) or on its internal homogeneous patterns or facies (e.g. Gao\n2008), often with supervised learning. The latter commonly use data classiﬁcation\nor image segmentation methods (e.g. Pitas and Kotropoulos 1992), and tend to look\nthrough the intrinsic variability of a whole dataset (e.g. de Matos et al. 2007; Zhao\net al. 2016), often with unsupervised learning. In this respect, the self-organizing\nmap (SOM, Kohonen 1986) and its probabilistic alternative, generative topographic\nmapping (GTM, Bishop et al. 1998), have proven to be efﬁcient clustering tools (e.g.\nMarroquín et al. 2009; Roy et al. 2014; Chopra and Marfurt 2014). Recent methods\nhave combined the use of unsupervised learning and external, or prior, information. For\ninstance, Hashemi et al. (2017) constrain the resulting clustering by prior probabilities\nexpanded from well log data, through an iterative grouping of clusters; Zhao et al.",

(2016) combine\na GTM model with user-deﬁned facies and preconditioning of attributes.\nSuch mixed approaches have not yet been proposed for object delineation purposes.\nHowever, they could aid in the design of a heterogeneous geobody detection method\nthat would allow for the characterization of intra-class facies variability. In particular,\nthe internal distribution of the various seismic facies of geobodies, be they layered,\nchaotic, transparent, deformed, compressive or other, is for now quantiﬁed rather by\na manual delineation of regions disclosing intuitively appealing facies groups. An\nautomated delineation of such geobodies that would involve their different types of\nfacies would be highly useful for faster and more robust interpretations.\nIn this paper, a novel methodology is proposed for the detection of multi-facies\ngeobodies in three-dimensional seismic data, while preserving their internal facies\nvariability and keeping track of the input uncertainty. The methodology relies on\nthe two-dimensional parameterization of an operator, and then propagates the trained\noperator to the third spatial direction of the seismic cube. It is applied for the detection\nof multi-facies mass-transport deposits (MTDs) on a three-dimensional seismic cube,\nfor which full-stack and partial-stack analyses are conducted.\nIn Sect. 2, the methodology is introduced step by step.

Here, two-dimensional textural features are used.\nThe statistical two-dimensional gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features\ninitially introduced by Haralick et al.

A GLCM is computed on a grayscale image with intensity values that have\nbeen reduced to a discrete number of gray levels, usually 256, 64 or 8.

Such a step aims at revealing the variety\nof facies in the seismic images—in other words, the various groups of points that may\noccur in the feature-represented dataset. The generative topographic mapping (GTM,\nBishop et al. 1998) is chosen. GTM represents the data points as mixtures of Gaussians\non m reference vectors. The GTM model maps a low-dimensional latent space into a\nnonlinear manifold of the same low dimension, but embedded within the data space,\nand which optimally ﬁts the data cloud. The reference vectors lie on this manifold;\nthey are thus organized on it according to their similarity (this organization is called\n“ranking”). The mapping relies on a set of nrbf radial basis functions. m and nrbf are\nuser-deﬁned parameters.\nEach data point can ﬁnally be attached to the mode of its probability distribution\nin the latent space, that is, to the reference vector with the highest probability in the\nmixture. This yields a clustering of all data points into m clusters, which are considered\nrepresentative of the various facies of the dataset, even if the term “facies” might refer\nto a group of clusters—with intra-group variability (e.g. Roy et al. 2014). The GTM\ncluster ranking advantageously preserves similarities between facies.\nFor one data point, the higher the probability value of the mode, the better the\nconﬁdence in its cluster assignment by GTM. Here, the median of this value for all\npoints (i.e. all seismic pixels) is used to assess the reliability of the clustering. If higher\nthan 0.5, this median ensures that the assignment of half of the pixels to their cluster\nwas determined with an absolute majority among clusters. Note, however, that this\nindicator controls the performance of the clustering regarding the set of input features.\nAt this stage, the data-driven part of the training is complete: all training samples\nhave a unique cluster label. This is followed by the introduction of external input in a\nsupervised manner.",

The method\ncould also be conducted with continuous values, for example if the prior probabilities\nwere obtained through an external computation or from other data. A conﬁdence value\nα ∈[0, 1] (α = 1 for high conﬁdence) is given together with the prior input X; α\ncharacterizes the conﬁdence in X considered as possibly non-entirely annotated data.\nThe present supervised step aims at building “modeled images” Y containing for\neach pixel t a posterior probability value Yt on the presence of an object, that take into\naccount both the data-driven clustering and the prior probabilities X. In this view, a\nunique posterior probability value yi will be assigned to every cluster Ci (Le Bouteiller\nand Charléty 2018).\nThis probability yi should then be representative of the values of X on all points\nof Ci. If X has the same value sk for all points of Ci, then yi = sk. Otherwise, an\noptimum has to be found for yi, to minimize the error between X and Y on the points\nof Ci.

The inter-trace distance is 25 m in\nboth horizontal directions, and the vertical sampling rate is 4 ms, so that the dimensions\nof one voxel are 4 ms × 25 m × 25 m, and those of a pixel in a vertical section are\n4 ms × 25 m. Three partially stacked datasets (near-offset, mid-offset and far-offset\ndatasets) and the full-stack dataset were considered. In a partial stack, each trace is the\ncombination of the seismic signals obtained for a given range of angles of incidence\nof the input seismic wave (small, medium or large). The full stack combines all of\nthem. All datasets have an average power signal-to-noise ratio between 10 and 11 dB,\na good-quality value for seismic data.\nThe targeted objects are mass-transport deposits (MTDs), sedimentary bodies\nresulting from mass wasting along a continental slope (e.g. Shipp et al. 2011). They are\ntypically characterized by several facies, including compressive-ridged, transparent,\ndeformed and/or chaotic facies, which typically involve patterns of different sizes,\norientations and gray-level intensity (e.g. Alves et al. 2014). A set of faults affects the\nsouthernmost region of the cube, where even manual delineation of objects is very\nuncertain.\nSix seismic sections oriented along the regional principal slope direction were\nchosen and interpreted manually, yielding one prior probability image for each. These\nprior probabilities take values in S = {s1 = 0, s2 = 0.25, s3 = 0.5, s4 = 0.75, s5 =\n1}. The α value associated with this prior interpretation is 0.8. The six sections were\nsplit into three training images (training set) and three validation images (validation\nset), as shown in Fig. 5.",

This\nsampling rate is typical of a manual interpretation of sections of a seismic cube.

Here, GLCM textural features have been computed on a binary seismic\nimage; additionally, only a two-dimensional texture representation by GLCM was\nused. Using a three-dimensional textural representation on vertical “thick slices” of\nthe cube (a few adjacent sections) with more gray levels would improve the precision of\nthe facies representations, especially for distinguishing patterns that may be the same\non a two-dimensional section but with different orientations in a three-dimensional\naspect. It would also allow one to acquire prior probabilities on sections non-parallel\nto each other—a constraint that an interpreter may impose if providing manual prior\ninput.\nUsing three dimensions and considering more gray levels for GLCM computations\nare both feasible (e.g. Eichkitz et al. 2015), but signiﬁcantly increase the computation\ntime, which can be limiting, for example for using a sufﬁciently precise sampling rate\nin the propagation phase.\nThe clustering step could also be modiﬁed. In this article, the GTM is used with\nno external constraint, and thus kept as unsupervised as possible. However, if the\nintention is to integrate geological knowledge from the start of the method, some\nspatial constraint could be added within the clustering itself (as proposed in SOM by\nZhao et al. (2017)), to produce clusters that are both consistent with seismic textures\nand constrained by stratigraphy.\nFuture applications may involve other kinds of multi-facies geobodies or regions\n(e.g. channels or gas chimneys), or regions characterized in seismic data by a certain\nrecognizable set of facies; applications may also use more detailed prior probabilities.\nThe cluster probability assignment (see Sect. 2.2) is actually applicable for a continu-\nous prior, so that external analyses based on another feature of the seismic image, or\na feature coming from well-extrapolated properties, could be used as a prior input.",

        "text": "The key principle of the proposed methodology lies in the combination of the ﬁrst\nunsupervised, data-driven step and the second supervised, prior-input-driven step, in\nthe training phase. By combining these two, one can be sure (i) not to miss any unseen\nfacies, as can be the case with directly supervised facies classiﬁcation methods, and\n(ii) to introduce prior input with some uncertainty information, thus addressing major\nissues (mentioned for example by Nivlet (2007)) regarding the uncertainty related to\nseismic facies classiﬁcation. The combination of these two steps may be seen as a way\nto combine two image segmentations: one issued from data-driven classiﬁcation, the\nother from object-focused interpretation.\nUsing the unsupervised clustering on only part of the dataset allows one to reduce\nthe associated computation time. For this, the training dataset should be representative\nof the whole dataset. Balancing computing time and prior information availability\ndetermines the choice of the training dataset accordingly.\nThe GTM unsupervised algorithm also gives an invaluable output: the cluster orga-\nnization or “ranking”. This information on how similar clusters are to each other comes\nalong with the clustering itself. It may enable one to analyze the internal facies distri-\nbution of speciﬁc objects, ﬁnding that it is characterized by, for instance, three facies\nof very distinct kinds or, on the contrary, by a set of clusters that are neighbors in the\n“ranking” (i.e. very similar in terms of seismic facies), suggesting a lower internal\nvariability of the objects.\nHere, the responsibility for the three-dimensional object-processing step is left to\nthe user. In this case, simple ﬁlters were applied; they could easily be implemented as\nan interactive numeric tool in seismic visualization software. For instance, by moving\na cursor corresponding to the size (or orientation) threshold, the user could change the\nﬁlter result, and hence update the visualization of retrieved geobodies. It is expected\nthat, with such an interaction, smaller objects may appear and suggest other interpre-\ntations for the very deﬁnition of the objects looked for.",

        "text": "Automated delineation of heterogeneous geobodies in two-dimensional or three-\ndimensional seismic data is a challenging task. To address this issue, a novel\nsemi-supervised methodology has been proposed in this article. The heterogeneous\nseismic signatures of the targeted geobodies can be represented by several textures,\nand not a unique, stable one from one object to another. To learn the appropriate\nway to distinguish the objects from the remaining part of the seismic image, a data-\ndriven analysis is ﬁrst conducted, followed by a supervised learning approach, on a\ntraining set. The training set includes delineations of the geobodies for a few seismic\nsections, together with prior uncertainty in the presence of the object. The resulting\nobject delineation thus includes some posterior uncertainty. This approach was tested\non partial-stack and full-stack seismic datasets to retrieve multi-facies mass-transport\ndeposits. The difﬁculty in MTD retrieval lies in their heterogeneous seismic signature.\nThe proposed workﬂow is shown to be effective, with good and robust results.",
