Comparing images to evaluate\nthe quality of segmentation is an essential part of measuring progress in this research area. Some of the challenges in\nevaluating medical segmentation are: metric selection, the use in the literature of multiple definitions for certain\nmetrics, inefficiency of the metric calculation implementations leading to difficulties with large volumes, and lack of\nsupport for fuzzy segmentation by existing metrics.\nResult: First we present an overview of 20 evaluation metrics selected based on a comprehensive literature review.\nFor fuzzy segmentation, which shows the level of membership of each voxel to multiple classes, fuzzy definitions of all\nmetrics are provided. We present a discussion about metric properties to provide a guide for selecting evaluation\nmetrics. Finally, we propose an efficient evaluation tool implementing the 20 selected metrics. The tool is optimized\nto perform efficiently in terms of speed and required memory, also if the image size is extremely large as in the case of\nwhole body MRI or CT volume segmentation. An implementation of this tool is available as an open source project.\nConclusion: We propose an efficient evaluation tool for 3D medical image segmentation using 20 evaluation metrics\nand provide guidelines for selecting a subset of these metrics that is suitable for the data and the segmentation task.",

        "text": "Gerig et al. [8] proposed a tool (Valmet) for evaluation of\nmedical volume segmentation. In this tool only five met-\nrics are implemented. There are important metrics, like\ninformation theoretical metrics as well as some statisti-\ncal metrics like Mahalanobis distance, and metrics with\nchance correction like Kappa and adjusted Rand index,\nthat are not implemented in the Valmet evaluation tool.\nFurthermore, this tool doesn’t provide support for fuzzy\nsegmentation. The ITK Library2 provides a software layer\nthat supports medical imaging tasks including segmenta-\ntion and registration. The ITK Library provides evaluation\nmetrics that are mostly based on distance transform fil-\nters [9]. However, this implementation has the following\nshortcomings: First, the ITK Library doesn’t implement all\nrelevant metrics needed for evaluating medical segmen-\ntation. Second, since most of the metrics are based on\ndistance transform filters, they are sensitive to increasing\nvolume grid size in terms of speed as well as memory used.\nOne way to reduce this effect is to use the bounding cube\n(scene) [6, 10], i.e. the smallest cube including both seg-\nments, that is to exclude from calculation all background\nvoxels not in the bounding cube. However, there are some\nshortcomings using the bounding cube, first the bounding\ncube remains large when the segments are large, far from\neach other or there are outliers far from the segments; sec-\nond, the bounding cube affects the results of metrics that\ndepend on the true negatives. In Section “Testing the effi\nciency”, we show that the ITK implementation of relevant\nmetrics fails to compare segmentations larger than a par-\nticular grid size. Since very large medical segmentations,\nlike those of whole body volumes, are already common,\nthis is a significant restriction.",

It is com-\nmon for this purpose to use a suitable triangular norm\n(t-norm) to calculate the agreement between two fuzzy\nassignments [11, 12]. Given two probabilities p1 and p2\nrepresenting the memberships of a particular element\n(voxel) to a particular class (segment) according to two dif-\nferent classifiers (segmenters), we use the min(p1, p2) as a\nt-norm as the agreement between the two classifiers. That\nis, we define the agreement function g :[ 0, 1] ×[ 0, 1] →\n[ 0, 1] that models the agreement on a particular voxel\nbeing assigned to a particular segment as g(p1, p2) =",

For medical\nsegmentation, this complexity could be a problem since\nthe size of medical volumes could reach 8-digit numbers.\nMethods (Huellermeier et al. [25], Brouwer [26], Campello\n[12]) have been proposed that calculate the Rand index\nand its extension for fuzzy segmentations using different\napproaches. None of these approaches is efficiently appli-\ncable in the 3D medical imaging domain because they all\nhave a run time complexity of O(n2). However, Anderson\net al. [27] proposed a method that calculates the four car-\ndinalities for fuzzy sets in O(n) runtime. This is achieved\nby combining two already known strategies: (i) calculating\nthe confusion matrix for fuzzy sets using some agreement\nfunction e.g. Eqs. 2 to 5 and (ii) calculating the four cardi-\nnalities by applying Eqs. 22 to 25 on the values of the fuzzy\nconfusion matrix calculated in (i). This approach is used in\nthis paper which means that Eqs. 26 to 29 already provide",

[42] in which a 3D cell grid\nis built on the point cloud and for each query point, a\nsearch subspace (a subset of the cell grids that contains the\nnearest neighbor) is found to limit the search and reduce\nthe number of distance calculations needed. We added\nthree modifications to this algorithm that make use of\nthe nature of segmentations, namely that they are mostly\ndense point clouds. These modifications enable efficiently\nfinding the exact NN. In the first modification, when cal-\nculating the pairwise distances from segment A to B, we\nremove the intersection A∩B from consideration because\nhere all the distances are zero, that is we calculate only\nA\\B to B. For the second modification, instead of consid-\nering all points of B, we consider only the points on the\nsurface of segment B. This is justified by the fact that when\nmoving in a line from a point in segment A (but not in the\nintersection) to the segment B, the first point crossed in\nB is on the surface and this is the shortest distance, which\nmeans all points inside the segments are not relevant. The\nthird modification is to find the radius r that defines a con-\nvenient search subspace for a given query point q ∈A.\nWe find r by moving from q to the mean of B and if a\npoint p ∈B is crossed, we define r as the distance between\nq and p, i.e. the search subspace consists of all cell grids\ncontained in or crossed by the sphere centered on q with\nradius r. If no point p is found (which is unlikely to happen\nwith segmentations), an exhaustive search is performed.",

The approaches described\nin [45] are based on defuzzification (finding a crisp rep-\nresentation) either by minimizing the feature distance,\nwhich leads to the problem of selecting the features, or\nby finding crisp representations with a higher resolution\nwhich leads to multiplication of the grid dimensions and\ntherefore negatively impacts the efficiency of time con-\nsuming algorithms, like HD and AVD. For this evaluation\ntool, we use a discrete form of the approach proposed in\n[46] i.e. the average of distances at different α-cuttings\ndepending on a given number of cutting levels k.

The first category is\ncaused by misinterpretation resulting in misleading def-\ninitions, for example the confusion of the pair counting\ncardinalities (a, b, c and d) with the overlap cardinalities\n(TP, FP, TN and FN). In some papers [12, 25, 27, 47],\nthe pair-counting cardinalities are used in place of the\noverlap cardinalities although they are mathematically\nand semantically different. According to the defini-\ntion, the pair-counting cardinalities result from grouping\nn(n −1)/2 tuples defined on X × X (Section “Basic\ncardinalities”) whereas the overlap-based cardinalities\n(Section “Basic cardinalities ’’) result from the class over-\nlap i.e. pairwise comparison of n voxel assignments. In the\npapers mentioned above, several overlap-based metrics\nincluding the Jaccard index are defined using the pair-\ncounting cardinalities in place of the overlap cardinalities.\nTo illustrate how strongly the results differ in the two\ncases, we show examples in Table 3. In each example, the\npartitions P1 and P2 are compared using the Jaccard index\nwhich is calculated in two ways: the first (JAC1) using the\noverlap cardinalities according to [14] and [48], the sec-\nond (JAC2) using the pair counting cardinalities according\nto [25, 27, 47] and [12]. The values are different except in\nthe first example.",

Therefore, to efficiently calculate the AVD, we use a\nmodified version of the nearest neighbor (NN) algorithm\nproposed by Zhao et al. [42] in which a 3D cell grid is\nbuilt on the point cloud and for each query point, a search\nsubspace (a subset of the cell grids that contains the near-\nest neighbor) is found to limit the search and reduce the\nnumber of distance calculations needed. We add three\nmodifications to this algorithm that achieve an optimal\nefficiency in finding the exact NN. These modifications\nmake use of the nature of segmentations, namely that they\nare mostly dense point clouds. In the first modification,\nwhen calculating the pairwise distances from segment A\nto B, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (1) to (4), we remove the inter-\nsection A ∩B from consideration because here all the\ndistances are zero, that is we calculate only A\\B to B. For\nthe second modification, instead of considering all points\nof B, we consider only the points on the surface of segment\nB as illustrated in Fig. 1 (5) and (6). This is justified by the\nfact that when moving in a line from a point in segment\nA (but not in the intersection) to the segment B, the first\npoint crossed in B is on the surface and this is the shortest\ndistance, which means all points inside the segments are\nnot relevant. Figure 1 (7) and (8) illustrate a real segmen-\ntation of the edema of a brain tumor and the boundary\nvoxels of the segmented edema. The third modification is\nto find the radius r that defines a convenient search sub-\nspace for a given query point q ∈A, as illustrated in Fig. 1\n(9). We find r by moving from q to the mean of B (m) and\nif a point p ∈B is crossed, we define r as the distance\nbetween q and p, i.e. the search subspace consists of all\ncell grids contained in or crossed by the sphere centered\non q with radius r. If no point p is found (which is unlikely\nto happen with segmentations), an exhaustive search is\nperformed.",

In the first two experiments (Sections Efficiency\ntest with brain tumor segmentation to Efficiency test\nwith whole body volumes), the proposed tool was tested\nagainst the implementation of the evaluation algorithms\nof the ITK library version 4.4.1, assumed to represent the\nstate-of-the-art. These ITK algorithms are based on the\ndistance transform technique, described in [51] and [52].\nOnly two metrics were considered, namely the Hausdorff\ndistance (HD) and average distance (AVD) because they\nare the most time and memory-consuming metrics.

The metrics in each of these groups\nstrongly correlate with each other, but have no correlation\nwith metrics in the other group.

While all\nmetrics in Group 2 include the true negatives in their def-\ninitions, none of the metrics in Group 1 does this. Note\nthat the adjusted Rand index and the kappa measures\nprincipally include the true negatives in their definitions,\nbut both of them perform chance adjustment, which elim-\ninates the impact of the true negatives, i.e. avoids that\nthe influence of the background dominates the result\n[55]. Also note that the average distance (AVD) and the\nMahalanobis distance (MHD) in Group 1 do not consider\nthe true negatives, since they are based on the distances\nbetween the foreground voxels (non-zero voxels). Con-\nsidering the true negatives in the evaluation has a large\nimpact on the result, since the background (normally the\nlargest part of the segmentation) contributes to the agree-\nment. Figure 4 illustrates, by means of a real example, how\nmetrics based on the true negatives change the resulting\nrankings when the true negatives are reduced by select-\ning a smaller bounding cube [10]. Such metrics are biased\nagainst the ratio between the total number of foreground\nvoxels and the number of the background voxels, which\nis denoted as the class imbalance. This leads to segmen-\ntations with large segments being penalized and those\nwith small ones being rewarded, a case that is common in\nmedical image segmentation e.g. when the quality of two\nsegmentations is to be compared, where one of them is\nlarger, and the other one is smaller than the ground truth\nsegmentation.

The volumetric similarity (VS) is\nnot suitable in this case. (ii) Distance based metrics are\nrecommended when the contour of the segmentation, i.e.\nthe accuracy at the boundary, is of importance [6]. This\nfollows from being the only category of metrics that takes\ninto consideration the spatial position of false negatives\nand false positives. (iii) The Hausdorff distance is sensi-\ntive to outliers and thus not recommended to be used\nwhen outliers are likely. However, methods for handling\nthe outliers, such as the quantile method [41], could solve\nthe problem, otherwise the average distance (AVG) and\nthe overlap based metrics as well as probabilistic based\nmetrics are known to be stable against outliers. (iv) Prob-\nabilistic distance (PBD) and overlap based metrics are\nrecommended when the alignment of the segments is of\ninterest rather than the overall segmentation accuracy [2].\n(v) Metrics considering the true negatives in their def-\ninitions have sensitivity to segment size. They reward\nsegmentations with small segments and penalize those\nwith large segments [10]. Therefore, they tend to gener-\nally penalize algorithms that aim to maximize recall and\nreward algorithms that aim to maximize precision. Such\nmetrics should be avoided in general, especially when the\nobjective is to reward recall (vi) When the segmenta-\ntions have a high class imbalance, e.g. segmentations with\nsmall segments, it is recommended to use metrics with\nchance adjustment, e.g. the Kappa measure (KAP) and the\nadjusted rand index (ARI) [29, 55]. (vii) When the seg-\nments are not solid, but rather have low densities, then\nall metrics that are based on volume or on the four cardi-\nnalities (TP, TN, FP, FN), are not recommended. In such\ncases distance-based metrics, especially MHD and HD,\nare recommended. (viii) Volumetric similarity is not rec-\nommended when the quality of the segmentations being\nevaluated is low in general, because the segments are\nlikely to have low overlap with their corresponding seg-\nments in the ground truth. In this case, overlap-based and\ndistance-based metrics are recommended. (ix) When the\nsegmented volume is of importance, volumetric similar-\nity and overlap based metrics are recommended rather\nthan distance based-metrics. (x) When more than one\nobjective is to be considered, which are in conflict, then\nit is recommended to to combine more than one met-\nric, so that each of the objective is considered by one of\nthe metrics. Thereby, it is recommended to possibly avoid\nselecting metrics that are strongly correlated (Fig. 3).",
