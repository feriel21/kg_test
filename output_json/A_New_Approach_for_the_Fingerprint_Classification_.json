It is based on the fact that a \nfingerprint image is composed of regular texture regions that can be \nsuccessfully represented by co-occurrence matrices. So, we first \nextract the features based on certain characteristics of the co-\noccurrence matrix and then we use these features to train a neural \nnetwork for classifying fingerprints into four common classes. The \nobtained results compared with the existing approaches demonstrate \nthe superior performance of our proposed approach. \n \nKeywords—Biometrics, fingerprint classification, gray level co-\noccurrence matrix, regular texture representation.",

Indeed, due to their \nuniqueness and unchangeability, fingerprints have widely \nused by many police agencies as a trusted biometric for \npersonal identification. However, the fingerprint recognition \nthat aims to find a match for a probe fingerprint in the \ndatabase of enrolled prints is extremely long because of an \nenormous number of personal records in the database (e.g. \nthere are more than millions of US`s criminal records). \nClassification \ncan help \nto accelerate the fingerprint \nrecognition. An automatic fingerprint classification method \naims to enhance the fingerprint images, to identify appropriate \nfeatures, to extract these features and finally to classify the \nfingerprints based on these features. Consequently, the time \nfor the matching task is significantly reduced. This is the \nreason why many agencies use classification methods to \nreduce the size of the search space to the fingerprints of the \nsame category before matching. Nowadays, the automatic \nfingerprint classification has become a routinely predominant \nprocess for personal identification and consequently should be \nreliable, does not create overlapping classes and processes \neach fingerprint in a short time.  \nThe first attempts to classify the fingerprints were made by \nGalton [1] and Henry [2].

The approaches are mostly based \non two main features in a fingerprint: 1) Global ridge and \nfurrow structures that form special patterns in the central \nregion of the fingerprint. 2) Local ridge and furrow minute \ndetails. Usually, a fingerprint is classified based on the first \ntype of features and is uniquely identified based on the second \ntype of features (ridge endings and bifurcations, also know a \nas minutiae). One advantage of this framework is that the \nridge structures can be global features, and therefore can often \nbe reliably extracted from images even in presence of hard \nnoise. \nThere are two main approaches for extracting information \nabout fingerprint ridge structures. One method is based on \ndeveloping a mathematical model of fingerprint ridges and \nrepresenting the fingerprint using these models. Another \napproach uses record characteristics of the ridges and stores \nthis information for classification. \nRecently, some papers have reported very good results in \nthe automatic classification of fingerprint databases. Jain et al. \nused the Gabor filter in four directions to extract features from \nfingerprints for classification [4]. In another attempt, they \nhave stored the shape information about the structure of \nfingerprint ridges for their classification scheme [5]. Each",

We selected randomly 365 images from four \nclasses to train our neural network. The resting 365 images \nwere used to test the classifier. Table I summarizes the results \nfor different number of neurons in second and third hidden \nlayers. As we can see, the neural network with 23 neurons for \nthe second layer and 8 neurons for the third layer correctly \nclassifies images in 99.02% with no misclassification. Note \nthat the neural network either finds a class for a given \nfingerprint image or announces that the image belongs to none \nof the classes. So, for the 0.98% of images, no class has been \nfound. We should mention that this table was obtained by",

In contrary, when d is grand, there is no enough \npattern structure between pixels that are far from each other. \nIn order to test the robustness of the proposed algorithm \nwith respect to noise image, we added “salt & pepper” noise \nto the test images. Fig. 3 shows the performance of the \nalgorithm for different fingerprint classes. As we can see, the \nbest and the worst robustness is related to Arch and Left Loop \nclasses, respectively.
