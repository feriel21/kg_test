(J Math Imag-\ningVis, doi:10.1007/s10851-016-0702-4, 2017) we propose\na new iterative multiplicative ﬁltering algorithm for label\nassignment matrices which can be used for the supervised\npartitioning of data. Starting with a row-normalized matrix\ncontaining the averaged distances between prior features and\nobserved ones, the method assigns in a very efﬁcient way\nlabels to the data. We interpret the algorithm as a gradient\nascent method with respect to a certain function on the prod-\nuct manifold of positive numbers followed by a reprojection\nonto a subset of the probability simplex consisting of vec-\ntors whose components are bounded away from zero by a\nsmall constant. While such boundedness away from zero is\nnecessary to avoid an arithmetic underﬂow, our convergence\nresults imply that they are also necessary for theoretical rea-\nsons. Numerical examples show that the proposed simple\nand fast algorithm leads to very good results. In particular\nwe apply the method for the partitioning of manifold-valued\nimages.",

In particular it can be used for image partition-\ning and segmentation, which is an important preprocessing\nstep for many state-of-the-art algorithms in high-level com-\nputer vision. It addresses the task to assign labels from a\nﬁnite set to the image points in a meaningful way. Thereby\nthe number of labels K is much smaller than the number n of\npoints in the discretized image. Figure 1 illustrates a typical\nlabeling result which leads to the segmentation of a texture\nimage.\nAs a ﬁrst ingredient for a labeling procedure, features of\neach pixel together with a similarity measure for these fea-\ntures are needed. In this paper we only deal with supervised\nlabeling where prototypical features for each label are avail-\nable. While for natural color images in the RGB color space\noften the ℓp-distance, p ∈{1, 2}, on R3 is sufﬁcient, this\nchoice is clearly not appropriate when dealing with manifold-\nvalued images. This is the case for example in Diffusion\nTensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DT-MRI), where the\nimage pixels are positive deﬁnite 3 × 3 matrices. Another\napplication is Electron Backscattered Diffraction, where the\npixels lie in a quotient manifold of the special orthogonal\ngroup. Also for the texture image in Fig. 1 we have to deal\nwith more appropriate features, actually means and covari-\nance matrices associated to the image pixels as described\nin the numerical part in Sect. 4, paragraph on “symmetric\npositive deﬁnite matrices”, second example.

We remark that there is a large amount of liter-\nature on the collection of appropriate image features and\na detailed description is beyond the scope of this paper.\nHowever, taking just features of single pixels and their dis-\ntances to prototypical label features into account would lead\nto a high sensitivity of the method to errors. To get robust\nlabeling procedures and to respect moreover the geome-\ntry of the image the local or nonlocal neighborhood of the\npixels should be incorporated as a second ingredient into\nthe labeling procedure. A ﬁrst idea would be a two step\nmethod which applies a neighborhood ﬁltering procedure\ndirectly on the image features followed by a label assign-\nment via comparison of distances to the prototypical label\nfeatures. The neighborhood ﬁlters may be local or nonlo-\ncal (Buades et al. 2010; Deledalle et al. 2009; Gilboa and\nOsher 2007) and linear or nonlinear (Tomasi and Manduchi\n1998). Indeed, such nonlinear methods may also comprise\nnonlinear diffusion ﬁlter (Buades et al. 2006; Weickert 1998)\nor variational restoration models inspired bythe Mumford–\nShah functional (Cai et al. 2013; Mumford and Shah 1989).\nHowever, such methods become rather complicated if the\nfeatures lie for example in a non ﬂat manifold. Then already\nthe simple local, linear averaging method calls for the com-\nputation of Karcher means which requires itself an iterative\nprocedure. Note that recently nonlocal patch-based methods\nwere extensively applied for the denoising of manifold-\nvalued images in Laus et al. (2016). In this paper, we will\napply the neighborhood ﬁltering not directly on the image\nfeatures, but on the so-called label assignment vectors. The\nlabel assignment vectors Wi :=\n\u0002\nWi,k\n\u0003K\nk=1 , i = 1, . . . , n,\ncontain the probabilities Wi,k that image pixel i belongs to\nlabel k. Thus, the Wi,k are nonnegative and sum up over k to 1.\nThey can be initially computed from the distances mentioned\nabove, i.e., a pixel is more likely to belong to label k if the dis-\ntance to the corresponding prototypical label feature is small.\nHence, our neighborhood ﬁltering process is independent\nof the considered feature space.

The models can roughly\nbe divided into continuous and discrete ones. Recent con-\ntinuous multilabel models as those in Bae et al. (2011),\nChambolle et al. (2012) and Lellmann and Schnörr (2011)\nconsider a convex functional which consists of a data term\nthat contains the distances between the pixel features and pro-\ntotypical features weighted by the label assignment vectors\nand a regularization term which enforces certain neighbor-\nhood relations on the label assignment vectors. A frequent\nchoice are isotropic total variation regularizers (Rudin et al.\n1992) and their relatives as wavelet-like terms (Häuser and\nSteidl 2013). The global minimizers can be found by pri-\nmal dual ﬁrst order methods (Burger et al. 2016; Chambolle\nand Pock 2011). In Chan et al. (2006) it was shown that the\nrelaxed two label method is tight, a promising result which is\nunfortunately no longer true for multilabel tasks (Lellmann\net al. 2013). Discrete models, in particular relaxed linear pro-\ngrams, are often the method of choice in computer vision\nsince they appear to be more efﬁcient for huge sets of high\ndimensional data. Moreover they are in general tighter than\ncontinuous models, see exemplary Kolmogorov (2006) and\nKolmogorov and Zabih (2004). For a comprehensive study\nof discrete energy minimizing methods also in the context of\nimage segmentation we refer to Kappes et al. (2015) which\nsigniﬁcantly expands the scope of methods involved in the\nearlier comparative study (Szeliski et al. 2008). The above\nmentioned continuous and discrete models are non-smooth\nand convex. We want to mention that there exist also non con-\nvex approaches as, e.g., those in Herault and Horaud (1993),\nHofmann and Buhmann (1997), Orland (1985), Wainwright\nand Jordan (2008) and Yedidia et al. (2005) which always\nhave to cope with local minima.\nRecently, Åström et al. (2017) suggested an interesting\nsupervised geometric approach to the labeling problem, see\nalso Åström et al. (2016a,b) for the corresponding confer-\nence papers. The objective function to maximize is deﬁned on\nthe open manifold of stochastic matrices with the Fisher–Rao\nmetric and a maximizing algorithm via the correspond-\ning Riemannian gradient ascent ﬂow is considered. In the\nnumerical part the authors apply several simpliﬁcations, in\nparticular lifting maps to cope with the non completeness\nof the manifold. Finally this leads to an iterative numerical\nprocedure. Unlike the continuous Riemannian gradient ﬂow\nthat is shown in Åström et al. (2017) to converge to edges\nof the simplex, the authors merely showed that the simpli-\nﬁed numerical scheme closely approximates this ﬂow, but",

(2017) may be hard to\nread for people not trained in differential geometry we show\nin Sect. 3 how their ﬁnal iteration scheme can be rewritten\nsuch that we arrive at an easily understandable algorithm.\nA slight modiﬁcation of this algorithm leads to our (even\nsimpler) algorithm reported in the next section.\nWestartwiththealgorithmfromÅströmetal.(2017)since\nwe want to introduce it from a user-friendly point of view as\na multiplicative ﬁltering process of label assignment vectors.\nWe initialize our iterations with a label assignment matrix\ncontaining label assignment vectors of averaged distances\nbetween the prior features and the observed ones. Matrices\nof this kind are common kernel matrices in nonlinear ﬁl-\nter (Buades et al. 2010; Tomasi and Manduchi 1998), patch-\nand graph Laplacian based methods, see e.g., Belkin and\nNiyogi (2003) and Elad and Aharon (2006). In particular\nthe data and their priors may lie in any metric space, which\nmakes the method highly ﬂexible. Then these label assign-\nment vectors are iterated in a multiplicative way, where we\nhave to take care that the components stay within the prob-\nability simplex and a (small) ﬁxed distance ε > 0 away\nfrom zero. We analyze the convergence of the algorithm\nif ε = 0. In exact arithmetic it appears that in most rele-\nvant cases the algorithm would converge to a trivial label\nassignment matrix. This is not the case if we demand that the\ncomponents are bounded away from zero by a small distance.\nSuch condition is used in the numerical part anyway to avoid\nan arithmetic underﬂow. However, the analysis shows that\nthere is also a theoretical reason for bounding the compo-\nnents away from zero. Indeed, in all numerical examples we\nobserved convergence of the algorithm to the vertices of the\nε probability simplex. We reinterpret our algorithm as gradi-\nent ascent step of a certain function on the product manifold\nof positive numbers followed by a reprojection onto the ε\nprobability simplex. The projection is done with respect to\ntheKullback–Leiblerdistance.Weprovidevariousnumerical\nexamples.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows: in Sect. 2 we\nintroduce and discuss our iterative multiplicative ﬁltering\nalgorithm: the simple algorithm is presented in Sect. 2.1,\nfollowed by its convergence analysis in the case that the\ncomponents of the label assignment vectors are not bounded\naway from zero in Sect. 2.2. We interpret the algorithm as\na gradient ascent step of a certain function followed by a\nKullback–Leiblerprojectionontotheε probabilitysimplexin\nSect. 2.3. The relation to paper Åström et al. (2017) together\nis detailed in Sect. 3. Numerical results demonstrate the very\ngood performance of our algorithm in Sect. 4. In particular\nwe apply the method for the partitioning of manifold-\nvalued images. The paper ﬁnishes with conclusions in\nSect. 5.",

We have chosen Step\n3 as stated in Algorithm 1 since together with Step 2 it has\na nice interpretation as Kullback–Leibler projection onto the\npart of the probability simplex with entries larger or equal\nto ε. However, we will see in the next subsection that Step\n3 is not just numerical cosmetics, but in general absolutely\nnecessary to avoid that the iterates W (r)\ni\nconverge to the same\nvertex of the simplex for all i = 1, . . . , n which would result\nin a trivial labeling.\nBy Step 1, the weight matrix P plays a crucial role. By\ndeﬁnition this matrix is symmetric and stochastic, i.e., it has\nnonnegative entries and P1n = 1n. We ﬁnish this subsec-\ntion by collecting some well-known properties of symmetric\nstochastic matrices, see e.g., the original papers Frobenius",

Of course there exists many more methods to\ncompare to; we chose these two, because the ﬁrst one is even\nsimpler, and the second one is a state-of-the-art variational\nmodel for image partitioning.\nIn Fig. 3 we compare these two methods with the multi-\nplicative labeling derived in this paper. In order to compare\nthe methods, we choose the parameters s, σ, λ from our\napproach, the Simple Labeling and the method from Cham-\nbolleet al.(2012), respectively, suchthat theyresult insimilar\nlabeling in the background, e.g., the fur in the middle right\npart of the image of the mandrill. We further focus on\nthree regions: the left eye, the left side of the nose and the\nleft nostril. The original image, shown in Fig. 3a, is labeled\nusing the prior features from the last example, cf. Fig. 2b.\nWhen we compare our method with local weights and\ns = 3, cf. Fig. 2c, whose focus regions are shown in Fig. 2c\nto the result of the Simple Labeling, cf. Fig. 3c, σ = 2.5, the\ndetails are kept sharper in our method, while they get blurred\nin the latter approach. This can clearly be seen at the nostril\nor the nose, where at least one additional label is introduced\nat the boundary, and the pupil is kept in its original size in\nour approach. However, in e.g., more homogeneous regions\nlike the red upper part of the nose or the fur in the top right,\nboth methods result in similar label assignments.\nCompared to the variational method from Chambolle et al.\n(2012) our approach seems to keep slightly more details, e.g.,\nat the boundary of the nose or the fur in the bottom right,\nwhile just loosing a few details, like the white spot in the\neye. Despite of these two minor differences they perform\nsimilar.",

        "text": "As a ﬁrst example we look at diffusion tensors occurring\nin magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI). For DT-MRI a\n3D dataset from MRI is used to compute diffusion tensors\nat each measurement position resulting in a dataset, where\neach data point is a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix. Hence\nall data items are given on the manifold P(3) of symmetric\npositive deﬁnite 3 × 3 matrices. The Camino project1 (Cook\net al. 2006) provides a freely available dataset of DT-MRI\nof the human head. We take a look at the traversal cut at\nz = 35 in the dataset, i.e., our data is a manifold-valued\nimage of size N × M with N = M = 112 where the pixels\noutside the head are missing, see Fig. 5a. The coloring is\nbased on the anisotropy index, cf. Moakher and Batchelor\n(2006), employing the Matlab colormap hsv.\nWe ignore the outer pixels in the following by setting their\ndistance (and hence inﬂuence) to any other pixel to zero. We\ndeﬁne two prior features, which are depicted as pink ellipses,\none denoting the inner, less diffusion affected area, one to\ncapture the boundary and main diffusion areas of the brain.\nWe compare three approaches, (i) an equally weighted neigh-\nborhood of size s × s, (ii) a weighted 3 × 3 using a truncated\nGaussian, σ = 0.5 and (iii) the nonlocal weights. We set\nsp = 3, snl = 9, t = 15, and for the two involved Gaussians\nσp = 3andσw = 1",

In contrast\nto the method for ﬁnding grain boundaries via threshold-\ning described in Bachmann et al.

The grain boundaries are\nsometimes too fringy in the original data. This happens since\nthe diffraction patterns are inaccurate at grain boundaries due\nto the change in orientation and therefore also the assigned\nrotations are inaccurate. Here, the labeling method performs\nbetter.\nIn the second example we draw our attention to multiphase\nEBSD data. We consider a multiphase dataset consisting of\nthe three phases Forsterite, Enstatite and Diopside taken from\nMTEX (Bachmann and Hielscher 2005). These phases have\ndifferent crystal symmetries such that we can not directly\ncompute the distance between orientations belonging to dif-\nferent phases. Therefore, the features have to represent not\nonly the orientations, but also the phase they are correspond-\ning to. We consider features ( fi, pi) where pi ∈{1, 2, 3}\ndenotes the phase and fi ∈SO(3)/S(pi) is the orientation\nwhere S(pi) denotes the symmetry group of the phase pi.\nThen we choose a ﬁnite, but constant distance τ between pix-\nels that belong to different phases to allow for phase changes\nof noisy pixels.
