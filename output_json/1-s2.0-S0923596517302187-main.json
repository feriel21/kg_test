Vice versa, image and video restoration techniques, such\nas inpainting or denoising, aim to enhance the quality of experience of human viewers. Correctly assessing\nthe similarity between an image and an undistorted reference image as subjectively experienced by a human\nviewer can thus lead to significant improvements in any transmission, compression, or restoration system. This\npaper introduces the Haar wavelet-based perceptual similarity index (HaarPSI), a novel and computationally\ninexpensive similarity measure for full reference image quality assessment. The HaarPSI utilizes the coefficients\nobtained from a Haar wavelet decomposition to assess local similarities between two images, as well as the\nrelative importance of image areas. The consistency of the HaarPSI with the human quality of experience was\nvalidated on four large benchmark databases containing thousands of differently distorted images. On these\ndatabases, the HaarPSI achieves higher correlations with human opinion scores than state-of-the-art full reference\nsimilarity measures like the structural similarity index (SSIM), the feature similarity index (FSIM), and the visual\nsaliency-based index (VSI). Along with the simple computational structure and the short execution time, these\nexperimental results suggest a high applicability of the HaarPSI in real world tasks.\n© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

        "text": "However, the method proposed in this paper as well as most image\nquality metrics developed recently follow a top-down approach. There,\ngeneral functional properties of the HVS (considered as a black box) are\nassumed in order to identify and to exploit image features correspond-\ning to the perceived quality. Prominent examples are the structural\nsimilarity index (SSIM) [9], visual information fidelity (VIF) [10], the\ngradient similarity measure (GSM) [11], spectral residual based simi-\nlarity (SR-SIM) [12], and the visual saliency-induced index (VSI) [13].\nThe SSIM [9] aims at taking into account the sensitivity of the human\nvisual system towards structural information. This is done by pooling\nthree complementary components, namely luminance similarity (com-\nparing local mean luminance values), contrast similarity (comparing\nlocal variances) and structural similarity, which is defined as the local\ncovariance between the reference image and its perturbed counterpart.\nAlthough being criticized [14], it is highly cited and among the most\npopular image quality assessment metrics. The SSIM was generalized\nfor a multi-scale setting by the multi-scale structural similarity index\n(MS-SSIM) [15]. One of the first information theoretic approaches to FR\nIQA was presented as visual information fidelity (VIF) [10]. VIF models\nthe wavelet coefficients as Gaussian Scale Mixtures and quantifies\nthe mutual information shared between reference and test images.\nThe information theoretic measure of mutual information is shown\nto be correlated to perceived image quality. Changes in contrast and\nstructure are captured by considering local gradients in [11], while the\nsquared difference in pixel values between the reference image and the\ndistorted image is used to measure luminance variations. This approach\nthus follows the basic framework of combining complementary feature\nmaps originally introduced in [9]. Additionally, masking effects are\nestimated, based on the local gradient magnitude of the reference image\nand incorporated when the two feature maps are combined. Spectral\nresidual-based similarity (SR-SIM) [12] takes into account changes in\nthe local horizontal and vertical gradient magnitudes. Additionally,\nit incorporates changes in a spectral residual-based visual saliency\nestimate. The visual saliency-induced index (VSI) [13] follows the same\nline as SR-SIM by combining similarities in the gradient magnitude\nand the visual saliency. However, it further exploits the visual saliency\nmap for weighting the spatial similarity pooling. Furthermore, [13] also\nexplores the influence of different saliency models on the performance of\nthe proposed image quality measure. A combination of two feature maps\nis also applied successfully by the feature similarity index (FSIM) [16].\nDue to its conceptual similarity to the proposed method, it will be\ndiscussed in more detail in a later section.",

After all, both measures have a similar\noverall structure and implement similar principles such as frequency\nand orientation selectivity. We assume that the reduced complexity of\nthe HaarPSI also limits uncontrollable side effects when accentuating\ndifferent aspects of the input images by varying the parameters 𝐶\nand 𝛼. This could improve the chance of successfully fitting subsets\nof benchmark databases when only considering two free parameters,\nbut also decrease the generalization error. Furthermore, the principle of\norientation selectivity is implemented differently in the HaarPSI in the\nsense that measurements regarding horizontal and vertical structures\nare only combined at the very end, that is, when taking the weighted\naverage. It is well known that orientation selectivity is a strong organiza-\ntion principle in the primary visual cortex, where neurons that are tuned\nto similar orientations are grouped together in so-called orientation\ncolumns [33]. It thus seems reasonable that a consistent separation of\nthe information yielded by vertical and horizontal filters has a positive\neffect on the correlations with human opinion scores.",
