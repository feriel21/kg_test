        "text": "Since about 10 Ma, a wedge of clastic sediment up to 10 km in thickness has accumulated near the mouth of the Amazon River, forming\nthe Amazon Fan. Thin-skinned extensional and contractional structures root into a common basal detachment, hundreds of kilometers long.\nExtensional faults have formed landward of the prograding delta slope and contractional folds and faults have formed seaward of it. By plan-\nview restoration, we show that extension and contraction balance. We therefore infer that slope instability has provided the driving force for\nthin-skinned deformation.\nOn seismic data, the detachment appears as a sharp surface within Late Cretaceous strata. However, there is no evidence at that level for\nsoft layers, such as evaporites or muds. Abnormal ﬂuid pressure provides a more reasonable mechanism for the detachment. At depths of\nseveral thousand meters, deep wells have encountered ﬂuid overpressures.\nAmongst the possible causes of abnormal ﬂuid pressures are compaction and hydrocarbon generation. Although compaction may have\ncontributed to ﬂuid overpressures encountered in wells, we argue that hydrocarbon generation provides the best explanation for detachment\nin Cretaceous rocks, which were old and lithiﬁed when it occurred. In particular, the broadly triangular area of detachment coincides with an\ninferred pod of Cenomanian–Turonian source rock, which is interpreted to have been in the gas window during detached deformation.\nWe have developed new techniques of sandbox modelling to investigate the geometries of fault patterns produced by ﬂuid ﬂow through\nporous media. For the Amazon Fan, we have been able to reproduce the structural pattern, on the assumption that ﬂuid overpressures existed\nover a broadly triangular area beneath the detachment.\nq 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The lithospheric proﬁle has the bulk of the Amazon\nFan resting on thinned crust of the continental margin, rather\nthan on oceanic crust.\nSince 1998 and 1999, BP (operator) and partners have\nexplored blocks BFZ-2 and BM-FZA-1 (Fig. 1), acquir-\ning additional seismic proﬁles and 3D seismic surveys,\nand drilling two deepwater wells.

        "text": "What is known about the deep structure of the Amazon\nFan is mainly a result of petroleum exploration.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the Brazilian state oil company,\nPetrobras, and foreign companies under risk contracts,\nstarted systematic exploration of the area. From early\nresults, Schaller (1971) described the stratigraphic\nsequences of the Foz do Amazonas Basin. Out of a total of\n51 wells, most were on the shelf (Fig. 1); but well 1-APS-\n51A (drilled by Exxon in 1982 in 438 m of water)\npenetrated nearly 4000 m of Amazon Fan sediment\n(Branda˜o & Feijo´, 1994, their Fig. 8.7). One of the ﬁrst\nseismic proﬁles to be released was across the upper part of\nthe fan (Petrobra´s, 1984). It revealed listric growth faults\nand associated rollover anticlines in an extensional domain\nabout 25 km long and 4 km deep. Subsequently, Figueiredo\n(1985) published a geological sketch map of the Amazon\nFan and surrounding area, as well as a longer seismic proﬁle\n(about 70 km) across the domain of growth faults. In 1976,\nPetrobras discovered a sub-commercial accumulation (Pir-\napema) with estimated recoverable reserves of some 880 bcf\nof gas (Figueiredo, 1985). As part of a synthesis of salt and\nshale tectonics around the Brazilian continental margin,\nSchaller and Dauzacker (1986) described another seismic\nproﬁle (89-RL-49), running about 15 km across the\nextensional domain. These authors attributed extensional\nstructures to slope instability, ﬂuid overpressures and\nassociated shale tectonics. Finally, from Petrobras data,\nBranda˜o and Feijo´ (1994) produced a detailed chronostrati-\ngraphic chart of the Foz do Amazonas Basin and described\nintervals from ﬁve key wells (1-APS-1, 1-APS-18, 1-APS-\n21, 1-APS-29 and 1-APS-51A).\nIn the 1990s, Brazil opened exploration to foreign\ncompanies, under the auspices of the Brazilian National\nPetroleum Agency (ANP). This led to widespread interest in\nthe Amazon Fan and its possible deep-water plays.\nRecent reviews have considered possible source rocks\n(Advocate et al., 1998), histories of subsidence and\nmaturation (Silva & da Maciel, 1998), and shallow gas",

The 3D seismic data were acquired for BP over an area\nof 6000 km2.\nCharacteristic seismic reﬂectors were identiﬁed, dated,\nand correlated across the area of study.

Strata onlapping the\nfold limbs provide evidence for coeval sedimentation and\ncontraction. In the cores of major anticlines, structural\ncomplexity and lack of seismic resolution make for difﬁcult\nand ambiguous interpretation. However, most structures\nappear to root into a sharp detachment near the top\nCretaceous.\nFor the top Miocene, a remarkable feature of the\nstructural pattern is its lack of bilateral symmetry\n(Fig. 3A). Structures in the northwest half of the fan\n(exploration block BFZ-2) are different from those in the\nsoutheast half of the fan (block BM-FZA-1). In the\nnorthwest block, the area of thin-skinned structures is\nabout 200 km wide. To account for observed variations in\nstratigraphic thickness, most of the deformation must have\noccurred during deposition of the Amazon Fan. Extensional\nstructures are slightly concave seawards. In contrast, the\nleading seaward edge of contractional structures is a lobe,\nconvex seawards. All around the lobe, the top Miocene has\nbeen uplifted in the hanging walls of reverse faults. On its\nﬂanks, faults are steep and may have strike-slip components.\nIn its hinge, thrusts break through to the current sea ﬂoor,\ncausing noticeable relief on 3D seismic images of the\nseabed. In places, canyons cut through hanging wall\nanticlines. Locally, the top Miocene reaches the sea ﬂoor\nalong a relatively steep ramp. As no corresponding ﬂat is\nvisible above Pliocene or Pleistocene sediment, we infer\nthat it must have been removed by erosion.\nThere is good evidence that these thin-skinned structures\nare due to slope instability, under the action of gravitation-\nally induced stresses, as suggested by Schaller and\nDauzacker (1986).",

Because of doubtful\ninterpretation, overlaps are almost certainly underestimated,\nboth in number and in width. Although fault lenses may be\nisolated, it requires little extrapolation to make them\ninterconnect. At this stage, the top Miocene is visible as a\nseries of discrete fault blocks (Fig. 5A). Restoration is then a\nsimple matter of closing the gaps and undoing the overlaps,\nin such a way as to minimize all misﬁts. For the Amazon\nFan, we have done this manually, assuming that the\nsurrounding area did not deform, and paying attention\nmore to closing the gaps than to undoing the overlaps. The\noperation results in a good ﬁt, except in the areas of overlaps\n(Fig. 5B). On comparing block patterns in the current and\nrestored states, we obtain displacement vectors for selected\nmaterial points.\nThe overall displacement pattern is noticeably asym-\nmetric about the axis of the Amazon Fan. Most vectors\ntrend nearly north–south, highly oblique to the symmetry\naxis of the fan, but nearly parallel to the axis of the main\nfrontal lobe.

In this way, we have\nbeen able to study the behaviour of granular materials, under\nthe effects of seepage forces and very small effective\nstresses (Mourgues & Cobbold, 2003). In horizontally\nlayered models, if materials have different grain sizes and\ntherefore different permeabilities, vertical proﬁles of ﬂuid\npressure are kink-like. Beneath any one sealing layer of\nsmall permeability, ﬂuid pressure may attain a nearly\nlithostatic value, so that the effective normal stress is very\nsmall. The layer interface then slips easily, forming a sharp\ndetachment.\nFor practical reasons, compressed air has been used as a\npore ﬂuid. Following a ﬁrst application to thrust wedges\n(Cobbold, Castro, & Mourgues, 2001), we have started to\nmodel the effects of slope instability (Mourgues & Cobbold,\n2003).\nConsider a horizontally layered model, at the boundaries\nof which air pressure is atmospheric, except over a given\nbasal window, where it is nearly lithostatic. Air ﬂows from\nbottom to top, according to Darcy’s law. If the operator tilts\nthe model, it will slip along the interface where pore\npressure is closest to lithostatic. The area that slips is found\nto overlie the basal window (Mourgues & Cobbold, 2003).\nIn order to have basal windows of any required shape, we\nhave constructed a new apparatus for feeding air to the base\nof a model, from a reservoir at uniform pressure (Fig. 7). At\nits base, the reservoir receives compressed air through\na system of perforated plates, which diffuse the ﬂow. From\nthe reservoir, air ﬂows through a ﬁrst sieve, into a series\nof rectangular tubes, 5 cm wide. The model itself rests on\na second sieve, which allows compressed air to ﬂow\nthrough it.",

The pressure in each tube\ndepends on the thickness of sand within it and also on the\nthickness and permeability of the overlying model. For a\ngiven model, by pre-selecting the thickness of sand in each\ntube, it is possible to have any desired steady value of basal\nﬂuid pressure. By varying the thickness of sand, from one\ntube to another, it is possible to approximate, stepwise\nhorizontally, to any required distribution of ﬂuid pressure.\nWe use U-tube manometers to monitor the pressure in the\nbasal reservoir, as well as within ﬁve of the tubes.\nAssuming that the ratio, l; of ﬂuid overpressure to\nlithostatic pressure was uniform and steady over a source\npod under the Amazon Fan, we have modelled its horizontal\ndistribution to within a resolution of 5 cm in the model,\nwhich is equivalent to about 20 km in nature. We have\nassumed that the source pod was broadly triangular in shape,\nas in Fig. 3D.\nWe built a wedge-shaped model of layered quartz sand\n(Figs. 7 and 8). The three tapering layers were of different\ngrain sizes: 315 mm for the lowermost layer, 125 mm for the\nintermediate one and 200 mm for the uppermost layer. This\nensured that the maximum value of l was at the base of the\nintermediate layer, as in the experiments of Cobbold et al.\n(2001) and Mourgues and Cobbold (2003). At the surface of\nthe model we laid a marker grid of thin sand stripes, 2.5 cm\napart (Fig. 8).\nOnce the model was in place, we tilted it and the\nunderlying apparatus though an angle of 88. We then\nincreased the ﬂuid pressure in the reservoir. At a pressure of\n4.5 cm of water (measured in a U-tube), the model started to\nslip (Fig. 8A). It did so only over an area within the central",

We therefore increased the ﬂuid pressure to\n4.7 cm of water, which produced a further slide (Fig. 8B).\nThis procedure we continued in steps, up to a maximal\npressure of 5.4 cm of water (Fig. 8D). As the pressure\nincreased, so the area of the slide widened, until it occupied\nalmost the entire area of modelled source pod. At later\nstages of sliding, new structures formed well within the\nlimits of the modelled source pod. Finally, the surface grid\nshowed that the central part of the model had slipped some\n10 cm, equivalent to about 40 km in nature. It also rotated\nclockwise about a pole that was close to the apex of the\nbroadly triangular source area.\nOn comparing our experimental results with the structure\nof the Amazon Fan, we notice similarities and differences.\nThe main similarities are the sharpness of the detachment\nand the area and shapes of thin-skinned structures.
