The problem is\nthat for higher layers, the invariances are extremely\ncomplex so are poorly captured by a simple quadratic\napproximation. Our approach, by contrast, provides a\nnon-parametric view of invariance, showing which pat-\nterns from the training set activate the feature map.\n(Donahue et al., 2013) show visualizations that iden-\ntify patches within a dataset that are responsible for\nstrong activations at higher layers in the model.

Fig. 7 attempts to answer this question\nby systematically occluding diﬀerent portions of the\ninput image with a grey square, and monitoring the\noutput of the classiﬁer.\nThe examples clearly show\nthe model is localizing the objects within the scene,\nas the probability of the correct class drops signiﬁ-\ncantly when the object is occluded. Fig. 7 also shows\nvisualizations from the strongest feature map of the\ntop convolution layer, in addition to activity in this\nmap (summed over spatial locations) as a function of\noccluder position. When the occluder covers the im-\nage region that appears in the visualization, we see a\nstrong drop in activity in the feature map. This shows\nthat the visualization genuinely corresponds to the im-\nage structure that stimulates that feature map, hence\nvalidating the other visualizations shown in Fig. 4 and\nFig. 2.",

        "text": "4.3. Correspondence Analysis\nDeep models diﬀer from many existing recognition ap-\nproaches in that there is no explicit mechanism for\nestablishing correspondence between speciﬁc object\nparts in diﬀerent images (e.g. faces have a particular\nspatial conﬁguration of the eyes and nose). However,\nan intriguing possibility is that deep models might be\nimplicitly computing them. To explore this, we take 5\nrandomly drawn dog images with frontal pose and sys-\ntematically mask out the same part of the face in each\nimage (e.g. all left eyes, see Fig. 8). For each image i,\nwe then compute: ϵl\ni = xl\ni−˜xl\ni, where xl\ni and ˜xl\ni are the\nfeature vectors at layer l for the original and occluded\nimages respectively.\nWe then measure the consis-\ntency of this diﬀerence vector ϵ between all related im-\nage pairs (i, j): ∆l = P5\ni,j=1,i̸=j H(sign(ϵl\ni), sign(ϵl\nj)),\nwhere H is Hamming distance.\nA lower value indi-\ncates greater consistency in the change resulting from\nthe masking operation, hence tighter correspondence\nbetween the same object parts in diﬀerent images\n(i.e. blocking the left eye changes the feature repre-\nsentation in a consistent way). In Table 1 we compare\nthe ∆score for three parts of the face (left eye, right\neye and nose) to random parts of the object, using fea-\ntures from layer l = 5 and l = 7. The lower score for\nthese parts, relative to random object regions, for the\nlayer 5 features show the model does establish some\ndegree of correspondence.",

Three test examples where we systematically cover up diﬀerent portions of the scene with a gray square (1st\ncolumn) and see how the top (layer 5) feature maps ((b) & (c)) and classiﬁer output ((d) & (e)) changes. (b): for each\nposition of the gray scale, we record the total activation in one layer 5 feature map (the one with the strongest response\nin the unoccluded image). (c): a visualization of this feature map projected down into the input image (black square),\nalong with visualizations of this map from other images. The ﬁrst row example shows the strongest feature to be the\ndog’s face. When this is covered-up the activity in the feature map decreases (blue area in (b)). (d): a map of correct\nclass probability, as a function of the position of the gray square. E.g. when the dog’s face is obscured, the probability\nfor “pomeranian” drops signiﬁcantly. (e): the most probable label as a function of occluder position. E.g. in the 1st row,\nfor most locations it is “pomeranian”, but if the dog’s face is obscured but not the ball, then it predicts “tennis ball”. In\nthe 2nd example, text on the car is the strongest feature in layer 5, but the classiﬁer is most sensitive to the wheel. The\n3rd example contains multiple objects. The strongest feature in layer 5 picks out the faces, but the classiﬁer is sensitive\nto the dog (blue region in (d)), since it uses multiple feature maps.",
