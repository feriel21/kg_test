Slope failures in the western North Atlantic appear to be more\nfrequent, and apart from a few huge failure complexes, on average smaller than those found in the eastern North Atlantic. On\nthe other hand, failures tend to occur on lower slopes in the eastern North Atlantic. This trend could be used to conclude\ninformation about the sediment strata of the landslides in these two areas; long slides seem to consist of softer, more fluid,\nmaterial, whereas short failures might contain of more stiff sediments. It is also found that a majority of failures on both sides of\nthe Atlantic are generated in a water depth window between 1000 and 1300 m, bringing internal waves and/or gas hydrates into\nplay as possible contributing factors. Failures in fjords are generally influenced and limited by the geometry of the environment\nthey occur in.\nD 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

This suggests that the influence of the\nrheology of the failed material might be a key factor.\nOne possible interpretation is that small slope fail-\nures occurring on relatively steeper slopes involve\nstiffer, less disintegrative, material (i.e., slump-type\nfailures). McAdoo et al. (2000) made a similar\nobservation. On the other hand, failures covering\nvast areas on low slopes might consist of a softer\nmaterial and become more mobile (i.e., debris flow).\nThis might in turn relate to variation in depositional\nprocesses on steep and low slopes. Several authors\nhave proposed that weak layers might be the source\nof the more mobile material (O’Leary, 1991;\nHaflidason et al., 2003, 2004). Combining this\nobservation with the correlations involving slope\nangle it might be allowed to suggest that on any\ngiven slope a failure consisting of stiffer material",

This may largely be due to the lack of small\nevents on the eastern North Atlantic margin, which\nweakens the control on the slope of the correlation\nline, since the values (and scatter of values) for large\nlandslides are similar for both western and eastern\nNorth Atlantic.\nThe collated data set does not yet provide a\nreasonable base for making assumptions of univer-\nsal behaviour of slope failure. Many more gaps in\nthe incomplete data set would need to be filled\nbefore any such conclusion could be reached.\nHowever, the dobviousT correlations between length,\nwidth, area cover and volume might support the\nidea that many submarine slides share similar\ncharacteristics. For example, the scatter plot repre-\nsenting length and width (Fig. 7i) suggests a\npossible relationship between these parameters.\nAlthough conclusions drawn from this point would\nhave to be taken with some caution, it would be\nvery interesting to prove if this relationship could\nlead to some kind of predictions for future slope\nfailure behaviour.\nThe involvement of trigger mechanisms has been\nmostly excluded in this discussion because there was\nno clear picture of any dominating mechanism in the\ndata set. Possible trigger mechanisms which are, or\nthought to be, most common, include earthquakes, gas\nhydrates, tectonic movement, solifluction, internal\nwaves, sediment overload, erosion, sea-level change,\nground-/freshwater seepage and, especially in fjords,\nhuman impact.\nIt is clear from our study that a much more\nmeaningful analysis could have been performed if\nmore modern high-resolution mapping data had been\navailable. Collecting high-resolution sidescan, multi-\nbeam and seismic data to get a complete picture of a\nsubmarine landslide and its surrounding environment,\ndimensions, surface and subsurface expression is a\nnecessity; not only for statistical analysis, but also to\ngive more insight in the processes involved in\nlandsliding. Geotechnical data from boreholes and\nsamples is likely to hold the key to understanding\nlandslide processes, but is rarely available. This is\nsometimes both technically difficult and expensive to\nobtain, although some such data exist already,\nparticularly in industry, which needs to be encouraged\nto release it to the academic community.
