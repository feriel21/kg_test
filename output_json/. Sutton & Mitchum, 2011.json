They make excellent analogs for interpreting older subsurface\nfeatures and reservoirs, and for geohazard analysis. These leveed-channel complexes and mass-transport deposits are assessed within a\n3D seismic survey, using detailed images of seafloor maps and stratal surfaces, artificially digitally colored, and vertically exaggerated to\ncreate optimal imaging. A large canyon head incises the present-day shelf margin of the Niger delta and traverses down the upper and lower\nslope for 45 km towards the southeast. At the canyon mouth, a large apron of leveed-channel complexes covers the slope and basin plain\nfor a distance of 30 km within the seismic survey. Large sediment waves occur on outer levees of channel bends, attaining heights of 200\nm. In some areas, synclinal limbs of individual sediment waves have been deformed by numerous rotated blocks along small listric faults\nto form small mappable MTDs.",

These contrasts are\npossible using volume-rendering techniques within a time inter-\nval of seismic data whereby the data are partially transparent.\nThe highest amplitudes are weighted highest, and low ampli-\ntudes and zero crossings are weighted lowest, allowing emphasis\non differing stratigraphic elements.
