Finally, we include a small number of marginal\nstatistics of the image pixels and lowpass coefﬁcients at\ndifferent scales. We develop an efﬁcient algorithm for\nsynthesizing images subject to these constraints, which\nutilizes iterative projections onto sets. We demonstrate\nthe necessity of each type of parameter by showing syn-\nthesis examples that fail when that subset of parameters\nis removed.

Nevertheless, the\ngeneral form of the hypothesis provides an appealing\nfoundation for texture modeling.\nMany variants of Julesz’ conjecture may be formu-\nlated. For example, a more restricted version of the\nconjecture states that there exist such sets of functions\nfor each individual texture, or for each subclass of tex-\nture. This form of the conjecture has been implicitly as-\nsumed in a number of texture models based on texture-\nspeciﬁc adaptive decompositions (e.g., Faugeras and\nPratt, 1980; Zhu et al., 1996; Manduchi and Portilla,\n1999). A more ambitious version of the conjecture\nstates that there exists a set of statistical measurements\nsuch that two textures are perceptually indistinguish-\nable if and only if they are drawn from RFs matching\nthose statistics. In this case, the set of statistical mea-\nsurements are both sufﬁcient and necessary to guaran-\ntee perceptual equivalence. This bidirectional connec-\ntion between statistics and perception is desirable, as it\nensures compactness as well as completeness (i.e., pre-\nvents over-parameterization) (Cano and Minh, 1988).\nThe ultimate goal is to achieve such a representation us-\ning, in addition, a set of visually meaningful parameters\nthat capture independent textural features. If one were\nto fully succeed in producing such a set, they would\nalso serve as a model for the early processes of human\nvision that are responsible for texture perception.",

First, the deﬁ-\nnition of perceptual equivalence is a loose one, and\ndepends critically on the conditions under which com-\nparisons are made. Many authors refer to preattentive\njudgements, in which a human subject must make a\nrapid decision (“same” or “different”) without careful\ninspection (e.g., Malik and Perona, 1990).\nAnother subtlety is that the perceptual side of the\nconjecture is stated in terms of individual images, but\nthe mathematical side is stated in terms of the statistics\nof abstract probabilistic entities (RFs). In order to rec-\noncile this inconsistency, one must assume that reason-\nable estimates of the statistics may be computed from\nsingle ﬁnite images. The relevant theoretical property\nis ergodicity: a spatially ergodic RF is one for which\nensemble expectations (such as those in the Julesz con-\njecture) are equal to spatial averages over the lattice, in\nthe limit as the lattice grows inﬁnitely large. A number\nof authors have discussed both the necessity of and the\ncomplications arising from this property when inter-\npreting the Julesz conjecture (e.g., Gagalowicz, 1981;\nYellott, 1993; Victor, 1994).\nBut ergodicity is an abstract property, deﬁned only\nin the limit of an image of inﬁnite size.

Speci-\nﬁcally, they created pairs of textures with the same\nNth-order pixel statistics that were strikingly differ-\nent in appearance (see Fig. 13). Many authors have\nused classiﬁcation tests (sometimes in the context of\nimage segmentation) to evaluate texture models (e.g.,\nChen and Pavlidis, 1983; Bergen and Adelson, 1986;\nTurner, 1986; Bovik et al., 1990). In most cases, this\ninvolves deﬁning a distance measure between vectors\nof statistics computed on each of two texture images,\nand comparing this with the discriminability of those\nimages by a human observer. This is usually done over\nsome ﬁxed test set of example textures, either artiﬁ-\ncial or photographic. But classiﬁcation provides a fairly\nweak test of the bidirectional Julesz conjecture.

It is highly unlikely\nthat such a pair (with exactly matching statistics) would\nhappen to be in the test set, unless the examples in the\nset were artiﬁcially constructed in this way. Alterna-\ntively suppose one has a candidate set of parameters\nthat is overconstrained. That is, there exist pairs of\ntexture images that look the same, but have different\nstatistics. Again, it is unlikely that such a pair would\nhappen to be in the test set.\nA more efﬁcient testing methodology may be de-\nvised if one has an algorithm for sampling from a\nRF with statistics matching the estimated statistics of\nan example texture image. The usual approach is re-\nferred to as “synthesis-by-analysis” (e.g. Faugeras and\nPratt, 1980; Gagalowicz, 1981; Cano and Minh, 1988;\nCadzow et al., 1993).

In\npractice, this choice seems to produce an Xt with fairly\nhigh entropy. By deciding not to insist on a uniform\n(and thus, maximal entropy) density over the Julesz\nensemble, we obtain a considerable gain in efﬁciency\nof the algorithm and ﬂexibility in the model, as we will\nshow throughout this paper.",

The texture synthesis algorithm devel-\noped by Heeger and Bergen (1995) is based on an itera-\ntive sequence of histogram-matching operations, each\nof which is an orthogonal projection onto a non-convex\nset.

These decompositions are\nalso widely used for tasks in computer vision. In ad-\ndition, recent studies of properties of natural images\nindicate that such decompositions can make acces-\nsible higher-order statistical regularities (e.g., Field,\n1987; Watson, 1987; Daugman, 1988; Zetzsche et al.,\n1993; Simoncelli, 1997). Especially relevant are re-\ncent results on choosing bases to optimize information-\ntheoretic criterion, which suggest that a basis of local-\nized oriented operators at multiple scales is optimal\nfor image representation (Olshausen and Field, 1996;\nBell and Sejnowski, 1997). Many authors have used\nsets of multi-scale bandpass ﬁlters for texture synthesis\n(Cano and Minh, 1988; Porat and Zeevi, 1989; Popat\nand Picard, 1993; Heeger and Bergen, 1995; Portilla\net al., 1996; Zhu et al., 1996; De Bonet and Viola,\n1997).\nWe wish to choose a ﬁxed multi-scale linear de-\ncomposition whose basis functions are spatially local-\nized, oriented, and roughly one octave in bandwidth.

The basis functions may be in-\nterpreted as directional derivatives of some lowpass\nkernel.\nFor this paper, we have extended the original steer-\nable pyramid representation to include complex “ana-\nlytic” ﬁlters. That is, the real and imaginary parts cor-\nrespond to a pair of even- and odd-symmetric ﬁlters\n(analogous to a Hilbert Transform pair in one dimen-\nsion). This allows us to utilize measures of local phase\nand energy in some of our texture descriptors. Such\nmeasures have proved important throughout computer\nvision (e.g., Knutsson and Granlund, 1983; Perona and\nMalik,1990),andareagainmotivatedbywhatisknown\nof biological vision.\nSimilar to conventional orthogonal wavelet decom-\npositions, the steerable pyramid is implemented by re-\ncursively splitting an image into a set of oriented sub-\nbands and a lowpass residual band.

To compensate for this, we double the\ncomplex phase of the coarse-scale coefﬁcients, and\ncompute the cross-correlation of these modiﬁed coefﬁ-\ncients with the ﬁne-scale coefﬁcients.

A recursive coarse-to-ﬁne procedure imposes the\nstatistical constraints on the lowpass and bandpass sub-\nbands, while simultaneously reconstructing a lowpass\nimage. A detailed diagram of this coarse-to-ﬁne pro-\ncedure is shown in Fig. 10. The autocorrelation of the\nreconstructed lowpass image is then adjusted, along\nwith the skew and kurtosis, and the result is added to\nthe variance-adjusted highpass band to obtain the syn-\nthesized texture image. The marginal statistics are im-\nposed on the pixels of this image, and the entire process\nis repeated. For accelerating the convergence, at the end\nof the loop we amplify the change in the image from\none iteration to the next by a factor 1.8. Details of each\nof the adjustment operations are given in the Appendix.\nThe algorithm we have described is fairly simple, but\nwe cannot guarantee convergence. The projection op-\nerations are not exactly orthogonal, and the constraint\nsurfaces are not all convex. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd that\nconvergence is achieved after about 50 iterations, for\nthe hundreds of textures we have synthesized. In ad-\ndition, once convergence has been achieved (to within\nsome tolerance), the synthetic textures are quite stable,\noscillating only slightly in their parameters. Figure 11\nshows the evolution of a synthetic texture, illustrat-\ning the rapid visual convergence of the algorithm.

In keeping with\nthe methodology prescribed in 2.2, we have created a\nset of artiﬁcial textures that have some of the attributes\nthat our model fails to reproduce. Figure 18 shows syn-\nthesis examples for these examples. The ﬁrst of these\ncontains black bars of all orientations on a white back-\nground. Although a texture of single-orientation bars\nis reproduced fairly well (see Fig. 12), the mixture of\nbar orientations in this example leads to the synthesis of\ncurved line segments. In general, the model is unable to\ndistinguish straight from curved contours, except when\nthe contours are all of the same orientation. The same\ntype of artifact may be seen in the synthesis of pine\nshoots (Fig. 16). The second example contains bars of\ndifferent grayscale value. The synthesized image does\nnot capture the abruptness of bar endings nearly as\nwell as the black-and-white example in Fig. 12. This\nis because the pixel marginal statistics provide an im-\nportant constraint in the black-and-white example, but\nare not as informative in the grayscale example. The\nthird example contains ellipses of all orientations. Al-\nthough the synthesized result contains black lines of\nappropriate thickness and curvature, most of them do\nnot form closed contours. A similar artifact is present\nin synthesis of beans (Fig. 16). This and the previous\nproblem are due in part to the lack of representation\nof “end points” in the model. Finally, the fourth exam-\nple contains polygonal patches of constant gray value.\nWithin each subband of the steerable pyramid, the local\nphase at polygon edges is equally likely to be positive\nas negative, and thus averages to zero. The local phase\ndescriptor is unable to distinguish lines and edges in\nthis case, and the resulting synthetic image has some\ntransitions that look like bright or dark lines, rather than\nstep edges. An analogous problem occurs with textures\ncontaining lines of different polarities. Again, the pixel\nmarginal statistics are not beneﬁcial in this example.",

In particular, con-\nsider the problem of extending a texture image be-\nyond its spatial boundaries (spatial extrapolation). We\nwant to synthesize an image in which the central pix-\nels contain a copy of the original image, and the sur-\nrounding pixels are synthesized based on the statis-\ntical measurements of the original image. The set of\nall images with the same central subset of pixels is\nconvex, and the projection onto such a convex set is\neasily inserted into the iterative loop of the synthe-\nsis algorithm. Speciﬁcally, we need only re-set the\ncentral pixels to the desired values on each iteration\nof the synthesis loop. In practice, this substitution is\ndone by multiplying the desired pixels by a smooth\nmask (a raised cosine) and adding this to the cur-\nrent synthesized image multiplied by the complement\nof this mask. The smooth mask prevents artifacts at\nthe boundary between original and synthesized pixels,\nwhereas convergence to the desired pixels within the\nmask support region is achieved almost perfectly. This\ntechnique is applicable to the restoration of pictures\nwhich have been destroyed in some subregion (“ﬁll-\ning holes”) (e.g., Hirani and Totsuka, 1996), although\nthe estimation of parameters from the defective image\nis not straightforward. Figure 19 shows a set of ex-\namples that have been spatially extrapolated using this\nmethod. Observe that the border between real and syn-\nthetic data is barely noticeable. An additional poten-\ntial beneﬁt is that the synthetic images are seamlessly\nperiodic (due to circular boundary-handling within\nour algorithm), and thus may be used to tile a larger\nimage.\nFinally, we consider the problem of creating a texture\nthat lies visually “in between” two other textures. The\nparameter space consisting of spatial averages of local\nfunctions has a type of convexity property in the limit as\nthe image lattice grows in size.3 Figure 20 shows three\nimages synthesized from parameters that are an aver-\nage of the parameters for two example textures. In all\nthree cases, the algorithm converges to an interesting-\nlooking image that appears to be a patchwise mix-\ntures of the two initial textures, rather than a new\nhomogeneous texture that lies perceptually between\nthem. Thus, in our model, the subset of parameters\ncorresponding to textures (homogeneous RFs) is not\nconvex!",

        "text": "constrained synthesis of boundary extrapolation. We\nﬁnd it especially remarkable that the model can re-\nproduce textures with complex structure and lighting\neffects.\nThe most fundamental issue in our model is the\nchoice of statistical constraints. We have motivated\nthese through observations of structural and statisti-\ncal properties of images, and “reverse-engineering” of\nearly human visual processing, and we have reﬁned\nand augmented these measurements by observing fail-\nures to synthesize particular types of texture. Never-\ntheless, there is room for improvement. First, the fail-\nures of Fig. 18 suggest that our constraint set is still\ninsufﬁcient. A more difﬁcult problem is that our par-\nticular choices are not unique, and we cannot be sure\nthat an alternative set of measurements would not pro-\nduce similar (or better) synthesis results. Finally, the\nfact that some regions of the parameter space do not\ncorrespond to homogeneous RFs (see the mixture tex-\ntures in Fig. 20) indicates that the current parameteriza-\ntion should be rearranged to give rise to a more useful\ntopological distribution of the subset of parameters that\ncorrespond to textures. Convexity of this subset, in par-\nticular, would bring us closer to deﬁning a perceptual\ndistance metric for texture, and would allow us to in-\nterpolate between texture examples.\nOur synthesis algorithm is closest to (and is, in fact,\na generalization of) that of Heeger and Bergen (1995).\nIt has the drawback that we cannot prove convergence.\nIn our experience with hundreds of texture examples,\nhowever, the algorithm has never failed to converge to\nan image that nearly satisﬁes the statistical constraints.\nA deeper problem is that our model (in particular, the\nimplicit probability density on the space of images) is\nnot fully determined by the set of constraints, but is\nalso determined by the sampling algorithm.\nIt is worth comparing our model with several re-\ncent successful texture models. By far the most suc-\ncessful approaches in terms of visual appearance have\nbeen the non-parametric sampling techniques (notably,\nPopat and Picard, 1993; De Bonet and Viola, 1997;\nEfros and Leung, 1999). Despite the beautiful synthe-\nsis results, however, these techniques do not provide a\ncompact representation of texture (the representation is\nthe example texture image). Additionally, they are not\neasily extensible to problems that require one to infer\na model from corrupted or partial information.\nAmongst the parametric approaches, high quality re-\nsults have been obtained using marginal histograms of\nﬁlter responses as statistical constraints (Heeger and",

        "text": "Bergen, 1995; Zhu et al., 1996). In the case of our\nparticular basis set, we ﬁnd that marginal statistics\nare insufﬁcient to represent many of the more com-\nplex textures. This is not to say that the marginals of\na larger set of ﬁlters would not be sufﬁcient. In fact,\nZhu et al. have shown, using a variant of the Fourier\nprojection-slice theorem used for tomographic recon-\nstruction, that large numbers of marginals are sufﬁcient\nto uniquely constrain a high-dimensional probability\ndensity (Zhu et al., 1996). But increasing the number of\nmarginals, in addition to making the representation less\ncompact, will also slow down the convergence of most\nsampling algorithms. It remains to be seen whether\nsimple models of the joint statistics, such as that in-\ntroduced in this paper, can provide a more efﬁcient\nrepresentation.\nAnother interesting concept used in a number of\nrecent models is to adapt the basis to the statistical\nproperties of each individual texture example (Bovik\net al., 1992; Francos et al., 1993; Portilla et al., 1996;\nZhu et al., 1997; Manduchi and Portilla, 1999). The\nmodel by Zhu et al., in particular, produces high-quality\nsynthesis examples using a surprisingly small set of ﬁl-\nters. The drawback with this approach is the additional\ncomputational expense (often substantial) in the ﬁlter-\nselection process.\nWe envision a number of extensions of our texture\nmodeling approach. The results can be made much\nmore visually compelling by introducing color.2 Pre-\nliminary results indicate that the alternating projections\napproach can be applied to other problems such as de-\nnoising (Portilla and Simoncelli, 2000). Since the rep-\nresentation of a texture image is quite compact, the syn-\nthesis technique might be used in conjunction with a\ncompression system in order to “fabricate” detail rather\nthan encode it exactly. Finally, we believe our synthe-\nsis approach might be extended for use in constrained\nsynthesis applications such as repairing defects (e.g.,\nscratches or holes), “super-resolution” zooming, and\n“painting” texture onto an image (e.g., Hertzmann,\n1998).",
