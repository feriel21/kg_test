Differences in the mean gray level or in \ncolor in small neighborhoods alone are not always \nsufficient for image segmentation. Rather, one has \nto rely on differences in the spatial arrangement \nof gray values of neighboring pixels--that is, on \ndifferences in texture. The problem of segmenting \nan image based on textural cues is referred to as the \ntexture segmentation problem. \nTexture segmentation involves identifying regions \nwith \"uniform\" textures in a given image. Appro- \npriate measures of texture are needed in order to \ndecide whether a given region has uniform texture. \nSklansky (o has suggested the following definition of \ntexture which is appropriate in the segmentation \ncontext: \"A region in an image has a constant texture \nif a set of local statistics or other local properties of \nthe picture are constant, slowly varying, or approxi- \nmately periodic\". Texture, therefore, has both local \nand global connotations--it is characterized by \ninvariance of certain local measures or properties \nover an image region. \nThe diversity of natural and artificial textures \nmakes it impossible to give a universal definition of \ntexture.

This approach \nis inspired by a multi-channel filtering theory for \nprocessing visual information in the early stages of \nthe human visual system. First proposed by Campbell \nand Robson (4) the theory holds that the visual system \ndecomposes the retinal image into a number of fil- \ntered images, each of which contains intensity vari- \nations over a narrow range of frequency (size) and \norientation. The psychophysical experiments that \nsuggested such a decomposition used various grating \npatterns as stimuli and were based on adaptation \ntechniques. I~l Subsequent psychophysiological ex- \nperiments provided additional evidence supporting \nthe theory. De Valois et al. ,(5) for example, recorded \nthe response of simple cells in the visual cortex of \nthe Macaque monkey to sinusoidal gratings with \ndifferent frequencies and orientations. \nIt was \nobserved that each cell responds to a narrow range \nof frequency and orientation only. Therefore, it \nappears that there are mechanisms in the visual \ncortex of mammals that are tuned to combinations \nof frequency and orientation in a narrow range. \nThese mechanisms are often referred to as channels, \nand are appropriately interpreted as band-pass \nfilters. \nThe multi-channel filtering approach to texture \nanalysis is intuitively appealing because it allows us \nto exploit differences in dominant sizes and orien- \ntations of different textures. Today, the need for a \nmulti-resolution approach to texture analysis is well \nrecognized. While other approaches to texture analy- \nsis have had to be extended to accommodate this \nparadigm, the multi-channel filtering approach, is \ninherently multi-resolutional. Another important",

Different multi- \nchannel filtering techniques that are proposed in the \nliterature differ in their approach to one or more of \nthe above issues. \nIn this paper, we present a multi-channel filtering \ntechnique for texture segmentation that uses a bank \nof even-symmetric Gabor filters to characterize the \nchannels. This filter set forms an approximate basis \nfor a wavelet transform, with the Gabor function as \nthe wavelet. We propose a systematic filter selection \nscheme which is based on reconstruction of the input \nimage from the filtered images. Each (selected) fil- \ntered image is subjected to a bounded nonlinear \ntransformation that behaves as a blob detector. The \ncombination of multi-channel filtering and the non- \nlinear stages can be viewed as performing a multi- \nscale blob detection. Texture discrimination is associ- \nated with differences in the attributes of these blobs \nin different regions. \nA statistical approach is then used where the attri- \nbutes of the blobs are captured by texture features \ndefined by a measure of \"energy\" in a small window \naround each pixel in each response image. This pro- \ncess generates one feature image corresponding to \neach filtered image (see Fig. 1). The size of the \nwindow for each response image is determined using \na simple formula involving the radial frequency to \nwhich the corresponding filter is tuned. A square- \nerror clustering algorithm is then used to identify the \ntexture categories. A simple procedure for inclusion \nof spatial (contextual) information in the clustering \nprocess is also proposed. A modification of the \nHubert F statistics is used as a relative index to \nestimate the \"true\" number of texture categories. \nThe performance of the algorithm is evaluated \nthrough application to images with a large number \nof natural textures, and images containing artificial \ntextures with identical second- and third-order stat- \nistics.",

Coggins (7) used a \ndifferent set of filters that are also specified in the \nspatial-frequency domain. Each filter has either fre- \nquency-selective or orientation-selective property, \nnot both. Coggins and Jain (7-9) have demonstrated \nthe utility of these filters for texture classification as \nwell as texture segmentation. \nMore recent techniques have used filters that are \nobtained by fitting band-limited functions to the \nreceptive field profiles of simple ceils in the visual \ncortex of some mammals. In signals and systems \nterminology, a receptive field profile can be inter- \npreted as the impulse response of the cell. Several \ninvestigators have used 2D Gabor filters.

Both radially \nsymmetric difference of Gaussians (DOG) filters, \nand directionally tuned difference of offset Gaussians \n(DOOG) filters are used. \nIn our texture segmentation technique, we rep- \nresent the channels with a bank of Gabor filters. \nExisting techniques use either complex-valued \nGabor filters (~°) or pairs of Gabor filters with quad- \nrature phase relationship.

        "text": "variations in an image. In order to ensure that the \nfilters do not respond to regions with constant inten- \nsity, we have set the MTF of each filter at (u, v) -- \n(0, 0) to zero. As a result, each filtered image has a \nzero mean. Figure 3 shows the filter set in a 256 × 256 \narray. \nThe set of filters used in our algorithm results in a \nnearly uniform coverage of the spatial-frequency \ndomain (Fig. 3). A decomposition obtained by the \nfilter set is nearly orthogonal, as the amount of \noverlap between the filters (in the spatial-frequency \ndomain) is small. One way to demonstrate this prop- \nerty is through reconstruction of an image from the \nfiltered images. Figure 4 shows two 128 × 128 images \nand their reconstructed versions. The original images \nare shown in the top row. The reconstructed images, \nobtained by adding all 24 filtered images, are in \nthe bottom row. (For the purpose of displaying the \nreconstructed image, we have linearly mapped the \ngray values to the interval 0-255.) \nThe filtering operations using the filter set can be \ninterpreted as computing the wavelet transform of \nthe input image at selected spatial-frequencies (fre- \nquency and orientation pairs). The wavelet trans- \nform is closely related to the window Fourier \ntransform. However, unlike window Fourier trans- \nforms where the window is fixed, the window size in \na wavelet transform is allowed to change according \nto frequency, t~9) Intuitively, a wavelet transform can \nbe interpreted as a band-pass filtering operation on \nthe input image. Although the Gabor function is an \nadmissible wavelet, it does not result in an orthog- \nonal decomposition. This mcans that a wavelet trans- \nform based on the Gabor wavelct is redundant. The \nability to reconstruct good approximations of the \ninput image from the filtered images demonstrates \nthat the filter set forms an almost completc basis for \nthe wavelet transform. \nThe interpretation of filtering operations, using \nour filter set as an approximate wavelet transform, \nis closely related to combined space-frequency image \nrepresentations. Porat and Zeevi 12\") have provided \na thorough analysis of image representation using \nGabor elementary \nfunctions \n(GEF). \nBovik 121) \naddresses optimality criteria for channel filters, \nwhere each \"narrow-band\" filter is expressed as the \nproduct of an equivalent low-pass filter with a com- \nplex sinusoidal plane wave. As a result, the filtering \noperations are reminiscent of window Fourier trans- \nforms. Also, Reed and Wechsler t22~ use a different \n\"spatial/spatial-frequency\" representation, based on \nWigner distribution, to study the texture seg- \nmentation and clustering/grouping problems. \nFigure 5 shows examples of filtered images for the \n\"D55-D68\" image which contains \"straw matting\" \n(D55) and \"wood grain\" (D68) textures from the \nphotographic album of textures by Brodatz323) To \nmaximize visibility, each filtered image has been \nscaled to full contrast.

Pattern clustering algorithms are ideal \nvehicles for recovering such clusters in the feature \nspace. \nA segmentation algorithm based on clustering pix- \nels using their associated feature vectors alone suffers \nfrom an important shortcoming--it does not utilize \nthe spatial (contextual) information. In texture seg- \nmentation, neighboring pixels are very likely to \nbelong to the same texture category. One possible \napproach to incorporate this contextual information \nis to use a relaxation labeling technique. That is, first \nobtain an initial labeling by clustering patterns in the \nfeature space, and then enforce the spatial con- \nstraints using relaxation. (29) Instead, we propose a \nsimple method that incorporates the spatial adjac- \nency information directly in the clustering process. \nThis is achieved by including the spatial coordinates \nof the pixels as two additional features (see Fig. 1). \nThe inclusion of spatial coordinates in the com- \nputation of the distance between feature vectors \nencourages neighboring pixels to cluster together. \nAs a result, over-fragmentation of otherwise uniform \ntexture regions is avoided. \nIn our texture segmentation experiments, we have \nused a square-error clustering algorithm known as \nCLUSTER3 3°) The algorithm iterates through two \nphases. Phase 1 (the K-means pass) creates a \nsequence of clusterings containing 2, 3 ..... \nkmax \nclusters, where kmax is specified by the user. Phase 2 \n(the forcing pass) then creates another set of clus- \nterings by merging existing clusters two at a time to \nsee if better clusterings can be obtained. After each \npass through phases 1 and 2, the square-errors of the \nclusterings are compared with the square-errors of \nthe clusterings that existed before that pass. (Each \nnew clustering is compared to an old clustering with \nthe same number of clusters.) If any of the square- \nerrors are smaller than before, another pass through \nphases 1 and 2 is initiated. This continues until \nsquare-error cannot be decreased.",

Intuitively, the clus- \nter centers are assumed to be the true representation \nof the texture categories, and any deviations from \nthe centers are assumed to be due to errors in \nmeasurements and distortions. Note that the MH \nindex will be 1 for the trivial clustering in which each \npattern is an individual cluster and is not defined for \nthe clustering in which all patterns are in the same \ncluster. \nThe \"true\" number of texture categories is esti- \nmated as follows. First, a sequence of clusterings is \nobtained using the CLUSTER algorithm. We assume \nthat km~ is known or can be reliably estimated. We \nplot MH(k) for k = 1 ..... \nkmax. The true number \nof categories is than determined by identifying a \n\"significant\" knee in the plot. When the data contain \na strong clustering, MH(k) first increases and then \nlevels off, and a significant knee is formed at the true \nnumber of clusters. The following intuitive jus- \ntification for this behavior is suggested by Dubes. (~!1 \nSuppose the true number of clusters is k*. The clus- \nterings with k > k* will then be formed by breaking \nthe true clusters into smaller ones. As a result, the \ncorrelation between the entries of X and Y matrices \nwill be high. The clusterings with k < k* clusters, \nhowever, will be formed by merging the true clusters, \nhence reducing the correlation. Therefore, assuming \nthat our texture features provide strong discrimi- \nnation between different texture categories, we \nshould see a significant knee in the plot of MH(k) at \nthe true value of k.",

As a \nresult, unlike some of the existing techniques, our \nsegmentation algorithm does not require any knowl- \nedge of the frequency content of textures in the input \nimage. In addition to psychophysical and psycho- \nphysiological studies, our choice of Gabor filters and \ntheir parameters was motivated by a goal to construct \nan approximate basis for a wavelet transform. \nThe use of a nonlinear transformation following \nthe linear filtering operations has been suggested as \none way to account for the inherently nonlinear \nnature of biological visual systems. (36) We argued \nthat the localized filtering by our Gabor filter set \nfollowed by a \"squashing\" nonlinear transformation \ncan be interpreted as a multi-scale blob detection \noperation. \nThe filtering and feature extraction operations in \nour algorithm account for most of the required com- \nputations. However, these operations can be per- \nformed in parallel, regardless of the number of filters. \nWhen certain assumptions hold, our filter selection \nscheme can be used to reduce the number of filtered \nimages that have to be processed. When computing \ntexture features, we provided a simple but important \ncriterion for determining the appropriate size of the \nlocal windows. We also proposed a simple but effec- \ntive method for incorporating the spatial information \nin the clustering process. \nOne of the limitations of our texture segmentation \nalgorithm is the lack of a criterion for choosing the \nvalue of tr in the nonlinear transformation. In our \nexperiments we used a fixed empirical value. Also, \nthe algorithm assumes that different channels are \nindependent from each other. However, there is \npsychophysical and physiological evidence indicating \ninhibitory interactions between different spatial \nfrequency channels. (~) Some researchers have in- \ncorporated such interactions in their texture seg- \nmentation algorithms. (16.37) Feature selection or \nextraction from the initial pool of features is com- \nputationally desirable, and may result in more accu- \nrate segmentations. Allowing inhibitory interactions \namong the channels is shown to have the potential \nto reduce the effective dimensionality of the feature \nspace. (37) \nIn our texture segmentation algorithm, we relied \non the plot of the MH index vs number of clusters \nto estimate the number of texture categories. The \ncost of computing these indices is fairly high and this \nindex does not perform very well, especially when \nthe number of true clusters is large. Cluster validity is \na difficult problem. It is our belief that an integrated \napproach that uses both a region-based and an edge- \nbased segmentation can be used to eliminate the \nneed for knowing the exact number of texture cat- \negories. Malik and Perona, (16) for example, have \ndeveloped a multi-channel filtering technique that \nproduces edge-based segmentations.

Differences in the mean gray level or \nin color in small neighborhoods alone are not always \nsufficient for image segmentation. Rather, one has \nto rely on differences in the spatial arrangement \nof gray values of neighboring pixels--that is, on \ndifferences in texture. The problem of segmenting \nan image based on textural cues is referred to as the \ntexture segmentation problem. \nIn this paper, we presented a multi-channel fil- \ntering-based texture segmentation technique that \nuses a bank of Gabor filters to characterize the \nchannels. We showed that the filter set forms an \napproximate basis for a wavelet transform, with the \nGabor function as the wavelet. We proposed a sys- \ntematic filter selection scheme which is based on \nreconstruction of the input image from the filtered \nimages. Each (selected) filtered image is subjected \nto a bounded nonlinear transformation that behaves \nas a \"blob detector\". The combination of multi- \nchannel filtering and the nonlinear stages can be \nviewed as performing a multi-scale blob detection. \nTexture discrimination is associated with differences \nin the attributes of these blobs in different regions. \nA statistical approach is then used where the attri- \nbutes of the blobs are captured by texture features \ndefined by a measure of \"energy\" in a small window \naround each pixel in each response image. This pro- \ncess generates one \"feature image\" corresponding to \neach filtered image. The size of the window for each \nresponse image is determined using a simple formula \ninvolving the radial frequency to which the cor- \nresponding filter is tuned. A square-error clustering \nalgorithm is then used to identify the texture cat- \negories. A simple procedure for inclusion of spatial \n(contextual) information in the clustering process \nis also proposed. A modification of the Hubert F \nstatistics is used as a relative index to estimate the \n\"true\" number of texture categories. The per- \nformance of the algorithm is evaluated through appli- \ncation to images with a large number of natural \ntextures, and images containing artificial textures \nwith identical second- and third-order statistics.",
