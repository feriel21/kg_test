How-\never, the relationship between mass-transport complex (MTC) emplacement and the timing and\nspatial progression of contractional deformation of the seabed have not been extensively studied.\nThis study uses high-quality, 3D seismic reﬂection data from the southern Magdalena Fan, offshore\nColombia to investigate how the growth of a deep-water fold-and-thrust belt (the southern Sin\u0001u fold\nbelt) is recorded in the source, distribution and size of MTCs. More than nine distinct, but coalesced\nMTCs overlie a major composite basal erosion surface. This surface formed by multiple syn- and\npost-tectonic mass-wasting events and is thus highly diachronous, thereby recording a protracted\nperiod of tectonism, seascape degradation and associated sedimentation. The size and source location\nof these MTCs changed through time: the oldest ‘detached’ MTCs are relatively small (over 9–\n100 km2 in area) and sourced from the ﬂanks of growing anticlines, whereas the younger ‘shelf-\nattached’ MTCs are considerably larger (more than 200–300 km2), are sourced from the shelf, and\npost-date the main phase of active folding and thrusting. Changes in the source, distribution and size\nof MTCs are tied to the sequential nucleation, ampliﬁcation and along-strike propagation of individ-\nual structures, showing that MTCs can be used to constrain the timing and style of contractional\ndeformation, and seascape evolution in time and space.",

Several studies\non active margins have investigated the mechanisms for\nslope failure and provide detailed descriptions of the\ndeposits resulting from fold degradation (e.g. Trincardi\n& Argnani, 1990; Moscardelli & Wood, 2008, 2015;\nRogers & Goodbred, 2010; Romero-Otero et al., 2010;\nAlfaro & Holz, 2014; Id\u0001arraga-Garc\u0001ıa & Vargas, 2014;\nVargas & Id\u0001arraga-Garc\u0001ıa, 2014). However, few relate\nMTC emplacement to the tectonostratigraphic evolu-\ntion of the basin margin. For example, Geersen et al.\n(2011) relate a series of large-scale slope collapses with\nthe regional tectonic history and present a two-dimen-\nsional model for the evolution of mass-failures offshore\nChile. Festa et al. (2015) present a detailed outcrop\nstudy that investigates the relationship between the dis-\ntribution of MTCs and the tectonostratigraphic evolu-\ntion of the northern Apennines. P\u0001erez et al. (2016)\ndocument variations in the dimensions, and vertical\nand spatial distribution of MTCs in several basins with\ndifferent deformation styles along the Scotia-Antarctica\nplate margin, and relate them the regional tectonic evo-\nlution. However, there is still a paucity of detailed,\nthree-dimensional analyses that link the timing, location\nand character of MTCs with the growth of individual\nstructures within developing deep-water fold-and-thrust\nbelts. Furthermore, the evolution and chronostrati-\ngraphic signiﬁcance of the basal surfaces underlying\nMTCs in areas of recurrent mass wasting has not been\nstudied previously.\nThis study is based on detailed mapping of the near-\nseabed, likely Pleistocene stratigraphy (Ortiz-Karpf et al.,\n2015), imaged in a 3D seismic reﬂection survey from the\nsouthern Magdalena Fan, offshore Colombia (Fig. 1).\nThe seismic survey is located at the northern tip of the\nsouthern Sin\u0001u fold belt, imaging the transition between\nimbricate thrust-cored anticlines to the south and a rela-\ntively undeformed area to the north (Fig. 1b). Here, sev-\neral MTCs were deposited at a time when the Magdalena\nFan was prograding under the inﬂuence of high sediment\nsupply and the southern Sin\u0001u fold belt was propagating\noutboard to the NW (e.g. Romero-Otero, 2009; Martinez\net al., 2015). Due to the location of the study area within\nthe fold-and-thrust belt and to the relatively recent\ntectonic deformation of the near-seabed sediments, the\ndegree of deformation is less advanced than in other areas\nalong the fold-and-thrust belt (Romero-Otero et al.,\n2010; Vinnels et al., 2010; Alfaro & Holz, 2014); the\nprimary tectonostratigraphic relationships and internal\ncharacteristics\nof\nthe\ndeposits\nare,\ntherefore,\nwell-preserved. The high resolution of the data and its\ntectonostratigraphic setting, therefore, enable: (i) the\nexamination of variations in the distribution, source and\nsize of the MTCs in response to growth of the deep-water",

        "text": "The Magdalena Fan is located in the Caribbean Sea, on\nthe northern coast of Colombia, northern South America\n(Fig. 1). The margin is tectonically active due to Creta-\nceous-to-Recent oblique subduction of the Caribbean\nPlate beneath the South American Plate (Duque-Caro,\n1979; Pindell, 1994; Meschede & Frisch, 1998; Cediel\net al., 2003; Pindell & Kennan, 2009). Plate convergence\nhas resulted in the formation of imbricate thrust folds,\nwhich have been active onshore since the Late Palaeocene\n(Flinch, 2003) and offshore since the Middle-Late Mio-\ncene (Cediel et al., 2003; Martinez et al., 2015). The off-\nshore Sin\u0001u fold belt is dominated by a series of thrust-\ncored anticlines that young to the north (Bernal-Olaya\net al., 2015; Martinez et al., 2015) and have experienced\nepisodic growth during the Plio-Pleistocene (Duque-\nCaro, 1979, 1984; Kolla & Bufﬂer, 1984; Cediel et al.,\n2003; Flinch, 2003). The Sin\u0001u fold belt is divided into\ntwo regions of active deformation (southern and northern\nSin\u0001u fold belts; Fig. 1b). The Magdalena Fan, which is\nbelieved to have been active since the Late Miocene\n(Duque-Caro, 1979, 1984; Kolla & Bufﬂer, 1984; Breen,\n1989; Romero-Otero, 2009), is located in a relatively\nundeformed area between the fold belts, extending off-\nshore into the Colombia Basin (Fig. 1b). Submarine fan\nsedimentation was coeval with subduction-induced struc-\ntural uplift and tectonic activity (Kolla & Bufﬂer, 1984;\nRomero-Otero, 2009; Romero-Otero et al., 2010; Vinnels\net al., 2010; Alfaro & Holz, 2014; Ortiz-Karpf et al.,\n2015).",

The seismic\nsurvey was acquired in 2008 and covers an area of\n1900 km2. It is Post-Stack Depth-Migrated (PSDM) and\nhas a bin spacing of 12.5 9 12.5 m. This study focuses\non the shallow stratigraphy (up to c. 1000 m below\nseabed), where the maximum frequency is 45 Hz and the\ndominant frequency is 30 Hz. By assuming a sediment\nvelocity of 1900 m s\u00011, which seems reasonable given the\nrelatively shallow depth of burial, these frequency and\nvelocity values yield a vertical resolution of c. 10–15 m\nand a horizontal resolution of c. 15 m. The water bottom\nis deﬁned by a positive reﬂection event, which is repre-\nsented by a black reﬂection in the presented seismic\nimages. Although a few wells have been drilled to the NE\nof the study area, they were not available for this study.",

However, \ndifferentiating between these two hypotheses is not critical to the overall \nobjective of this study and they are also interpreted as megaclasts (cf. \nMcGilvery et al., 2004; Bull et al., 2009; Frey-Martinez, 2010; Jackson, \n2011; Posamentier & Martinsen, 2011; Olaﬁranye et al., 2013; Alves, \n2015). The geometry of the folds can be used to infer the MTC ﬂow \ndirection, with the fold axes interpreted to be orientated broadly \nperpendicular to ﬂow direction and the folds verging in the down-ﬂow \ndirection (cf. Jones, 1939; Woodcock, 1976; Bull et al., 2009). When the \nfolds are symmetric, only the azimuth of the ﬂow can be determined.",

This section describes\nthe structures whose growth led to or controlled emplace-\nment of the MTCs.\nTowards the northern tip of the southern Sin\u0001u fold\nbelt, NE-SW-striking thrusts bend towards the east,\nresulting in an overall rotation of the deformation front\ntowards the continent (Figs 1b and 2). Within the study\narea, two thrust sheets are imaged (Fig. 2). Basinwards\nthree more thrust sheets are present to the SW of the seis-\nmic volume (Fig. 2). In the study area, the western and\neastern thrust sheets are each associated with large anticli-\nnes, herein referred to as the downdip anticline (DA) and\nupdip anticline (UA), respectively (Fig. 2). These anticli-\nnes are separated by a narrow syncline, herein referred to\nas the syncline (Fig. 3).\nThe DA is divided into a northern and southern\ndomain, which are separated by a saddle (Fig. 3a). The\nsouthern downdip anticline (SDA) is asymmetric, with its\nsteepest ﬂank dipping to the NW. The anticline is cored\nby the southern fault zone (SFZ), which comprises three\nsubparallel thrust faults that strike SW-NE and dip to the\nSE (Fig. 3a, c). The relief of the anticline increases to the\nSW, and the displacement, strike and lateral separation of\nthe underlying faults vary. Towards the NE, the faults\ncurve towards the east (Fig. 3a), become steeper and lose\ndisplacement before ultimately tipping out.\nTowards the northern tip of the SFZ, the DA becomes\nprogressively more symmetric, and its axis rotates\ntowards the east (Fig. 3a). Here, the anticline plunges\nslightly to the NE to form the saddle (Fig. 3d) separating\nit from the northern downdip anticline (NDA). Towards\nthe NE, the axis of the anticline rotates towards the east\n(Fig. 3a) and the anticline becomes broad and symmetric\n(Fig. 3a, b). The NDA is unfaulted, and it does not have\na seabed expression because it has been greatly eroded\n(Fig. 3b).",

The UA is expressed at the\nseabed, although its geometry has been modiﬁed by ero-\nsion (Fig. 3c). The thrust coring the UA also curves to\nthe east and continues to the NE, bending towards the\nshelf (Figs 2 and 3a).\nAccording to Martinez et al. (2015), the structures in\nthe study area have experienced episodic growth since the\nLate Miocene. This protracted growth history is evi-\ndenced by thinning of the stratigraphic packages against\nthe DA and UA, and increased sediment thickness into\nthe syncline (Fig. 3b, c), which together indicate the pres-\nence of growth strata. Because these folds have deformed\nthe seabed, and their underlying thrusts displace shallow\nstratigraphy (Fig. 3c), the last period of uplift of these\nstructures is interpreted to have occurred relatively\nrecently and potentially coincides with the latest stage of\nuplift, associated with the Late Pleistocene avulsion of the\nMagdalena River (Romero-Otero, 2009). However, the\nyoungest MTCs and the overlying channel–levee com-\nplex sets are not faulted and onlap the downdip anticline\n(Fig. 3c). This reﬂects a period of tectonic quiescence\nand active fan sedimentation post-dating the latest epi-\nsode of fold-and-thrust activity.",

The southeastern external levee of one\nof these channel–levee complex sets separates S4 from\nS3 (Figs 5d and 6d). To the NW, S4 overlies the rem-\nnant external levee that constitutes the limit between\nthe southern and central regions (Fig. 5d). S4 is trun-\ncated by S5 to the SW and by S6 to the NE and trun-\ncates S3 (Figs 5d, e, 6a and 8a, b). S4 can be traced\nupdip onto the SDA, where it is folded, faulted\n(Fig. 8a) and truncated by C1 (Fig. 5d). S4 is composed\nof two packages separated by a laterally continuous,\nhigh-amplitude erosion surface that suggests the pres-\nence of two stacked MTCs (Fig. 8a); both are composed\nof debrites with few megaclasts (Figs 5d and 6d). The\nmegaclasts are concentrated in the SW (Fig. 5d). The\norientation of the lateral boundaries of S4, which follow\nthe trend of underlying channel–levee complex sets,\nsuggest deposition from a NE- or SW-directed ﬂow\n(Fig. 6d); however, there are no additional kinematic\nindicators to support either interpretation.\nMTC S5 overlies an erosion surface that incises S3 and\nS4 (Fig. 6a). To the NW, as in S4, it is limited by the\nexternal levee deposits that deﬁne the boundary between\nthe southern and central regions (Fig. 5e).

S5 is com-\nposed of debrites towards the margins and, in its centre,\nby continuous reﬂections that form asymmetric to recum-\nbent, NE-verging folds contained within deformed mega-\nclasts (Figs 5e and 7a, d). To the NE, the transition from\nfolded facies to debrite coincides with the shallowing of\nthe basal surface and thinning of the deposit (Fig. 7c–e).\nBased on the orientation of the axes of the folds within the\nmegaclasts (WNW-ESE; Fig. 7d), their NNE fold ver-\ngence (Fig. 8b), and the presence of erosional scours and\ngrooves at the base of S5 (Fig. 7c), the emplacement\ndirection of the ﬂow depositing S5 is interpreted to be\ntowards the NNE.\nMTC S6 overlies an erosion surface that incises S5 and\nS4 (Fig. 8a, b) and is overlain by channel–levee complex\nsets (Fig. 8). As in S4 and S5, to the NW, it thins against\nthe external levee that deﬁnes the boundary between the\nsouthern and central regions (Figs 5f and 8d); although\nan erosion surface can locally be observed between MTC\nS6 and MTC C1 (Fig. 5), it is not consistently traceable,\nmeaning it is possible that S6 is part of C1 (Fig. 6a). To\nthe SW, S6 thins and pinches-out against relief developed\nalong the upper surface of S5 (Figs 5g and 8).

In the syncline, the lateral walls to\nC1 are steep and formed by the back limb of the NDA\nand the frontal limb of the UA (Fig. 9d). Basinward of\nthe downdip anticline, C1, is bounded to the SE by the\nexternal levee remnant that separates the southern and\nthe central regions and to the NW by the southern exter-\nnal levee of an underlying SW-trending channel–levee\ncomplex set (Fig. 9e). C1 covers an area of c. 300 km2",

C1 is not incorpo-\nrated into or deformed by the fold-and-thrust belt and is\noverlain by channel–levee complex sets that onlap the\nMTC and the ﬂanking anticlines (Fig. 9c).\nC1 is mainly composed of debrites, and it is also inter-\nnally deformed by imbricate thrusts and folds, which are\nconcentrated towards the centre of the deposit where it is\nthickest (up to 200 m) (Fig. 9a–c). Towards its margins,\nthe deposit is thinner (up to 50 m) and consists of lower-\namplitude debrites (Fig. 9a, b). The deposit thins to\n≤50 m across the downdip anticline, where it contains\nabundant megaclasts in a thin matrix formed by debrites\n(Fig. 9). Megaclasts are identiﬁed throughout C1 and are\ninternally folded (Fig. 9b, e).\nIn the syncline, thrusts within C1 dip to the NE\n(Fig. 9c), suggesting emplacement by a SW-directed\nﬂow, an interpretation supported by the SW orienta-\ntion of the lateral scarps (Fig. 9a, b). Further down-\ndip, in the basin low, thrusts dip to the SE (Fig. 9c),\nindicating emplacement by a broadly NW-directed\nﬂow. This inferred emplacement direction is supported",

Furthermore, eastward thinning of\nS1–S5 against the western ﬂank of the SDA suggests that\nsome structural relief existed prior to the emplacement of\nMTCs S1–S5 and that they are likely syn-tectonic\n(Fig. 12a). In contrast, S6 is not faulted or folded and is\noverlain by largely undeformed channel–levee complex\nsets that passively onlap the ﬂanking anticlines (Fig. 8b);\nS6 is, therefore, interpreted as post-tectonic. In the cen-\ntral region, the MTCs pre-dating C1 in the syncline are\nfolded and thin against the ﬂanks (Fig. 10), and they are,\ntherefore, interpreted as syn-tectonic. C1 is post-tectonic\nbecause it is undeformed and is onlapped by undeformed\nchannel–levee\ncomplex\nsets\n(Fig. 9c);\nit,\ntherefore,\ndeﬁnes the transition from syn- to post-tectonic sedi-\nments. In the southern part of the syncline, the transition\nfrom folded and faulted MTCs to undeformed MTCs\noccurs at a similar stratigraphic level to C1 (Fig. 10c, d),\nindicating that the UA and DA were active at broadly the\nsame time. Similarly, in the northern region, N1 and N2\nare underlain by MTCs that thin against the NDA, sug-\ngesting that they are syn-tectonic (Fig. 11d). Conversely,\nN1 and N2 are themselves undeformed and overlain by\nundeformed, onlapping channel–levee complex sets and\nare, therefore, post-tectonic (Fig. 11b). The age relation-\nship between syn-tectonic MTCs in the southern, central\nand northern regions cannot be established with conﬁ-\ndence.\nThe emplacement direction of the southern MTCs is\nchallenging to constrain with conﬁdence because the\nMTCs extend to the SW of the study area (Fig. 5). S5\ncontains\nthe\nmost convincing\nkinematic\nindicators,\nwhich\ntogether\nsupport\nan\nemplacement\ndirection\ntowards the NNE (Fig. 12b): NNE orientated grooves\nand scours at the base (Fig. 7c), and NE-verging folds\nwithin megaclasts (Fig. 8b) with WNW-ESE orientated\nfold axes (Fig. 7d). The elongate morphology of S1–S3\n(Fig. 5), their northward onlap against the underlying\nlevee (Fig. 6a) and the NE-SW alignment of the mega-\nclasts in S2–S3 (Figs 5 and 6b–d) also suggest this\nemplacement direction. Therefore, MTCs S1–S3 and\nS5 could have been sourced from local collapse of the\nsouthern part of the SDA or other anticlines to the SW\nof the dataset (Fig. 12b). MTCs S1–S3 and S5 are,\nthus, classiﬁed as detached MTCs (sensu Moscardelli &\nWood, 2008). Estimated runout distances for MTCs\nS1–S3 could be c. 10, 15 and 20 km, respectively. The\nabrupt increase in quantity and size of megaclasts in S5\n(Table 2) could reﬂect a shorter runout distance, and it\nis more likely that S5 was sourced from the southern\npart of the SDA (Fig. 12b). Similar mass wasting of\ndeep-water fold-and-thrust belts has been documented\nsouth of the study area (Romero-Otero et al., 2010; Vin-\nnels et al., 2010; Alfaro & Holz, 2014). The provenance\nof S4 is uncertain because there are no ﬂow direction\nindicators, its northeastern portion is folded and eroded\nby S6 and C1 (Fig. 8a), and it is only partially imaged\nby the seismic survey. S4 may have been also sourced\nfrom the SW. Alternatively, given that it follows the",

The shelf break thus\nrepresents the potential source area for C1, suggesting\nthis deposit is best classiﬁed as a shelf-attached MTC\n(sensu Moscardelli & Wood, 2008). There are multiple\npossible sources for the syn-tectonic MTCs that underlie\nC1 in the syncline.

Nonetheless, it remains possible\nthat some ﬂows, possibly including S6, traversed the\nstructure prior to the emplacement of C1, potentially\nacross the lower relief saddle between the SDA and\nNDA, and that the deposits associated with these ﬂows\nwere subsequently eroded by C1.\nAs the anticlines grew, the syncline and areas basin-\nward of the DA were ﬁlled by MTCs derived from the\ndegradation of the growing structures (Fig. 13b): S3\noccupied a greater area and extended further N than S2\n(Table 2, Fig. 12b), S4 was emplaced to the NW of S1–\nS3, and syn-tectonic MTCs where sourced from the fron-\ntal limb of the DA (Fig. 13b).\nS5 was the last and largest MTC sourced from the SW,\nand it was likely derived from the southern part of the\nSDA (Fig. 13c). It eroded S3 and S4 and extended fur-\nther to the NE. After S5 was emplaced, thin-skinned\nshortening and folding culminated with faulting of both\nfold cores (Fig. 13c). Faulting would have generated fur-\nther instability due to steepening of the anticline frontal\nlimbs. S6 was then deposited; it could have been sourced\nfrom the frontal limb of the DA or derived further updip\n(Fig. 13c). N1 was also emplaced after tectonic activity\nhad stopped in that area, being deposited along the trend\nof a long-lived sediment ﬂow-pathway deﬁned by stacked\nchannel–levee complex sets (Fig. 13c). The DA was\ndegraded progressively by erosion of the back limb of the\nSDA and possibly by retrogradational collapse of the\nfrontal limb (Fig. 13c).\nThe cessation of tectonic activity would have led to\ndecreased\naccommodation\nas\nthe\nsyncline\nﬁlled.\nDecreased accommodation and degradation of the folds at\nthe saddle between the SDA and NDA would have\nallowed larger, shelf-attached MTCs to traverse the anti-\ncline, establishing a conduit between the syncline and the\ndeep basin (Fig. 13d). In the northern region, N2 fol-\nlowed the trend of N1, leading to widening of the erosion\nsurface.\nProgressive degradation of the DA by several ero-\nsional ﬂows that were initially conﬁned in the syncline\neventually connected the shelf break with the basin-\nlow downdip of the structures.

        "text": "margins also report systematic variations in the morphol-\nogy and distribution of syn-tectonic sedimentary packages\nwith continued structural uplift. In the Apennines, Festa\net al. (2015) observed systematic shifts in the occurrence\nof MTCs in the direction of propagation of the fold-and-\nthrust belt, and an increase in the volume of the MTCs\nthrough time. In the Niger Delta, variations in the archi-\ntecture, morphology and distribution of MTCs and chan-\nnel–levee complex sets were also documented in a syn-\ntectonic stratigraphic package in the vicinity of a fold\n(Clark & Cartwright, 2009, 2012); these variations were\nused to constrain the evolution of the fold (Clark & Car-\ntright, 2012). These observations suggest that systematic,\nfold-belt-driven shifts in MTC source areas are reﬂected\nin the morphology, distribution and characteristics of the\ndeposit, and that this link is common to both active and\npassive margins. The results presented here are, thus,\npotentially applicable to other fold-and-thrust belts\naround the world.\nChanges in source are reﬂected in the size of the\nMTCs: the syn-tectonic MTCs are detached and cover\nareas of c. 9–100 km2 within the study area (Table 2); the\npost-tectonic MTCs are shelf-attached and have areal\nextents of at least 200–300 km2 (Table 2). These ﬁndings\nare in accordance with those of Moscardelli & Wood\n(2008, 2015), who found that detached MTCs have areas\nof tens of km2, whereas attached MTCs can be hundreds\nto thousands of km2 in area. The difference between the\nvolumes of detached and shelf-attached MTCs can be\nreadily explained by considering the volumes of material\navailable at the source; these volumes are likely to be\nsmaller along local ﬂank collapses than on the delta-fed\nshelf break. However, the evolution of the seascape dur-\ning degradation and sedimentation can also play an\nimportant role in the areal extent, runout distance and\ntherefore the distribution of MTCs. For example, in the\nsouthern region, there is a progressive increase in the area\nand down-ﬂow extent of the syn-tectonic, detached\nMTCs (S1–S5, Table 2). This could be explained by the\nsequential steepening of the frontal limbs of the growing\nanticlines, which could have resulted in progressively lar-\nger failures. Also, the emplacement of earlier MTCs\nimmediately downdip of the forelimb would have\nsmoothed the break-in-slope contributing to the progres-\nsively longer runout distances and larger areal extents.\nThe greater areal extents and runout distances of the\nshelf-attached MTCs (C1, N1 and N2, Table 2) are also\nthe result of smoothing of the slope proﬁle through pro-\ngressive degradation of the folds. The distribution, mor-\nphology and scale of the resulting MTCs, therefore,\nreﬂect changes in source areas induced by the combined\neffects of structural growth and syn-tectonic and post-tec-\ntonic degradation of the thrust-and-fold belt. Such\nchanges in external MTC characteristics should also be\nreﬂected in their internal composition, impacting their\nability to act as hydrocarbon reservoirs or seals (e.g. Gam-\nboa et al., 2010; Omosanya & Alves, 2013; Alves et al.,\n2014).",

        "text": "Sedimentation of syn-tectonic MTCs (S1–S5) shifted\nprogressively to the NE, likely reﬂecting changes in\nsource area. After the last episode of uplift, which culmi-\nnated in propagation of the faults that core the DA and\nthe UA, MTC source areas shifted towards the NE closer\nto the shelf break, and shelf-attached MTCs were\nemplaced (MTCs C1, N1 and N2). These change could\nhave been controlled by the evolution of the structures or\ncould be attributed to externally driven, more regional\ncontrols, such as increased sediment supply, eustatic sea-\nlevel change, gas-hydrate dissolution and/or seismicity\n(e.g. Manley & Flood, 1988; Beaubouef & Friedmann,\n2000; Maslin et al., 2004; Frey-Martinez et al., 2005;\nGrozic, 2010; Masson et al., 2010; Alfaro & Holz, 2014).\nAlong the northern coast of Colombia, during the Pleis-\ntocene, uplift of the Sin\u0001u fold belt was accompanied by\nuplift of the northern Andes, which coincided with\nchanges in eustatic sea-level and regional climate (van der\nHammen, 1958, 1974; Duque-Caro, 1979; Hooghiemstra\n& Ran, 1994; Ortiz-Karpf et al., 2015). Also, in the Plio-\nPleistocene, there were nine avulsions of the Magdalena\nRiver (Romero-Otero, 2009), which would have caused\nabrupt changes in sediment input and dispersal patterns.\nTherefore, several external forcing mechanisms can be\ninvoked for the emplacement of the shelf-attached MTCs\n(Ortiz-Karpf et al., 2015). However, the UA bends to the\neast towards the area of the shelf where the arcuate scarps,\ninterpreted as a possible source for the shelf-attached\nMTCs, are located (Fig. 12b). It is, therefore, likely that\nuplift associated with the propagation of the thrust that\ncores the UA induced the development of steep, unstable\nareas close to the shelf.\nThe results of this study suggest a northward shift in\nthe source area of the MTCs through time, coinciding\nwith the propagation direction of the structures (e.g. Ber-\nnal-Olaya et al., 2015; Martinez et al., 2015). This local\nﬁnding suggests that systematic shifts in MTC source\nareas through time could be investigated in other areas\nalong the margin to help constrain the evolution of the\nentire Sin\u0001u fold belt.

        "text": "The recent tectonostratigraphic evolution of the fold-\nand-thrust belt resulted in the formation of an erosion\nsurface that is overlain by at least nine distinct MTCs\n(Fig. 13). This composite surface was widened and deep-\nened by multiple erosional ﬂows and is, therefore, time\ntransgressive. The basal surface developed during a per-\niod dominated by thin-skinned contraction, folding and\nthrusting, and syn- and post-tectonic fold degradation,\npresumably over a protracted period of time. In addition\nto the speciﬁc MTCs identiﬁed and described, local col-\nlapse of the lateral walls, evidenced by the arcuate scarps\nat the margins of the basal surfaces of N1 and N2\n(Fig. 11C), also contributed to widening the composite\nbasal erosion surface.\nPrevious studies suggest that time-transgressive MTC\nbasal surfaces are common. Using 3D seismic from off-\nshore Israel, Frey-Martinez et al. (2005) document at\nleast three large-scale slumps related to and emplaced on\na continuous basal shear surface. On the Exmouth Pla-\nteau, Scarselli et al. (2013) report a series of MTCs in the\nLate Pliocene-Recent stratigraphy, interpreting the dif-\nferent orientations of grooves in the basal surface to reﬂect\ndifferent transport directions resulting from the multi-\nstage evolution of the complex. The models for syn-tec-\ntonic fold degradation presented by Heini€o & Davies\n(2006) and Geersen et al. (2011) also imply repeated epi-\nsodes of mass wasting and sedimentation. Therefore,\ndespite the quasi-instantaneous emplacement of individ-\nual MTCs, their deposits may coalesce above composite\nbasal surfaces that are time transgressive. In other words,\nthese composite basal surfaces are transferred into the\nrock record, but probably never were a geomorphic sur-\nface (cf. Strong & Paola, 2008).\nThe identiﬁcation of discrete MTCs is likely limited\nby dataset resolution. For instance, the basal surface of\nUnit D (Ortiz-Karpf et al., 2015), which is overlain by\nMTCs of various ages, is a continuous reﬂection that\ncan be mapped across the study area (Fig. 4). At deeper\nburial depths, the composite nature of similar erosion\nsurfaces at the base of multiple stacked MTCs might\nnot be resolvable, and thus be interpreted as a geomor-\nphic surface overlain by a single MTC, obscuring the\ncomplex tectonostratigraphic history that led to its for-\nmation. Distinguishing between single and composite\nMTC basal surfaces can impact the interpretation of\nsedimentary basin burial histories, which are commonly\nused to evaluate the timing of hydrocarbon generation\nand expulsion. It can also inﬂuence the prediction of the\ncharacteristics and distribution of the sedimentary pack-\nages downdip of the MTCs. Furthermore, the presence\nof coalescing MTCs can introduce lateral facies variabil-\nity and affect the prediction of sealing capacity (e.g.\nGamboa et al., 2010; Omosanya & Alves, 2013; Alves\net al., 2014).",
