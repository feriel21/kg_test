        "text": "An extensive study of Late Pleistocene continental slope submarine mass movements was undertaken. Twenty-six well-dated mass\nmovements occurred during the last 45 ka BP in the North Atlantic sector. A latitudinal trend is observed: between 45 and 12 ka BP most\nevents occur in the mid- to low-latitudes, post-12 ka BP high-latitude occurring events dominate. A cluster of events is associated with the\nLast Glacial sea level lowstand and Termination 1B. Further events are associated with Termination 1A and the Holocene. Prior to\n23 ka BP no clear relationship with the ice core atmospheric methane record is observed, in contrast during and following the\ndeglaciation there is a possible relationship with atmospheric methane. High-latitude mass movements are primarily controlled by\ncyrospheric-induced variations in sedimentation and local sea level. In high latitudes, the glaciation subdues mass movement activity\nthrough reduced seisimicity, sediment supply and ocean temperatures. Deglaciation increases the sediment supply, seisimicity and ocean\ntemperatures, thus increasing the likelihood of continental slope failures. For example the Storegga event coincides with high isostatic\nuplift and postglacial seisimicity, while the Andøya and Trænadjupet events occur before and after the peak rates respectively. In contrast\nlow latitudes experience greater risk of slope failures during glacial periods from falling sea levels, although during the deglacial and\ninterglacial period there is a potential for failure from changes in deposition centres and rates, as well as warming ocean temperatures\npotentially leading to dissociation of gas hydrates. The ongoing rapid deglaciation of coastal Greenland and Antarctica and consequent\nrapid input of sediment, isostatic uplift, crustal stress release and warming bottom water temperature at the shelf break will increase the\nrisk of continental slope failure in these regions.\nr 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Sediments\ndeposited in a state where shear strength exceeds shear\nstress will be stable. However, an alteration of this state,\nthrough either a reduction in sediment shear strength or\nthrough an increase in shear stress operating on that\nsediment, can lead to failure (see Biscontin et al., 2004).\nFrom a geological perspective, we distinguish two distinct\ncategories of process that combine to produce the change\nin state from stable slope to failure and mass movement.\nFor a slope to fail, it must ﬁrst be susceptible to failure.\nThis is a product of geological history and local environ-\nmental conditions. For example the development of a low\nporosity layer, in an otherwise relatively porous environ-\nment, will lead to an increase in susceptibility to fail\nthrough\nprevention of pore water expulsion (during\nsedimentary loading) and the development of overpressure\n(see Dugan and Flemings, 2000; Volpi et al., 2003;\nBiscontin et al., 2004). Sedimentation patterns, glacial\nhistory and geological uplift are all factors that may\ninﬂuence a slope’s susceptibility to fail without actually\ntriggering a mass movement, or failure, event.\nThere\nis\na\ndistinction\nbetween\nfactors\nincreasing\nsusceptibility to failure and those, which trigger the event.\nActual failure occurs when a susceptible slope is affected by\na triggering mechanism sufﬁcient to destabilise it. Trigger\nmechanisms tend to be identiﬁable events with clear\ntemporal constraints. For instance an earthquake, or\ndestabilisation of a gas hydrate reservoir. This trigger will\nthen inﬂuence the slope’s geometry or sedimentological\nproperties causing it to fail. During an earthquake seismic\nshaking leads to vertical and horizontal movement which\nincreases the gravimetric forces operating on the sediments\nand the pore pressure: reducing the sediment shear strength\nallowing failure to occur (see Wright and Rathje, 2003;\nMartel, 2004; Strout and Tjelta, 2005).\nClimate change and mass movement may, therefore,\ninteract in the ﬁrst instance through the effect of climate",

The uplift of the continental side of the slope,\ncoupled with the ﬂooding of the ocean basins (by rising sea\nlevel) leading to basin subsidence, causes slope steepening\n(see Van Weering et al., 1998). A steeper slope increases the\ndownslope gravimetric forces (the shear stress) increasing\nthe likelihood of failure. Submarine landslides can origi-\nnate on nearly ﬂat surfaces. Slope angles on the Mississippi\ndelta are generallyo0.41, in this area mudslides caused by\nHurricane Camille (1969) destroyed two platforms (see Bea\net al., 1983) and mudslides have been documented on\nangles of 0.011 (see Hampton et al., 1996 and references\ncited within; Coleman et al., 1998; Walsh et al., 2006). A\nchange in slope angle of o11 can be very signiﬁcant in\nterms of a slope’s engineering safety factor and its\nsusceptibility to fail.\nRapid sedimentation and variation in sedimentation\ntype as associated with the glacial cycles leaves a distinct\nsedimentary column. During interglacials pelagic sedimen-\ntation tends to dominate. This produces clays, silts and\nmuds: sediments associated with high water content.\nDuring\nglacials\nand\nparticularly\nduring\ndeglaciation,\nglaciogenic sedimentation dominates. This is associated\nwith a very rapid input of terrigenous sediments (see\nDowdeswell and Elverhøi, 2002). Deposited on top of\nsoft pelagic muds, the glaciogenic sediment will compact\nthem and force the pore ﬂuids out of the pore spaces\nand into migration. However, upon reaching the less\npermeable glaciogenic sediment, overpressure will build up\ncausing a reduction in sediment shear strength and the\ndevelopment of a weak layer (see Orange and Breen, 1992;\nDugan and Flemings, 2000; Volpi et al., 2003; Strout and\nTjelta, 2005). A contrast must be drawn, on glaciated\nmargins, between sedimentary fan locations and inter-fan\nlocations. Work on the svalbard margin by Dowdeswell\nand Elverhøi (2002) demonstrates that the fan areas are\ncharacterised by major sedimentary input during full\nglacial conditions. Inter-fan areas, however, receive high\nrates of sedimentation with the glacial advance, very low\nsedimentation during the LGM and then a rapid increase\nin sedimentation rates during the deglaciation. Return to\ninterglacial conditions during the Holocene is associated\nwith low rates of sedimentation.",

The muds and hemi-\npelagic sediments, which follow, will tend to have a lower\npermeability due to lower rates of deposition and more\nefﬁcient compaction.

Sediments deposited may lack ﬁne-\ngrained fraction. Once these units are loaded and over-\npressured by sediment deposition in the next glacial cycle\nthere is a potential for failure.\nOn the Norwegian margin contouritic sediments are\nimportant in determining the susceptibility of the slope to\nfuture failure. Inﬁll drift contourites are deposited in\nexisting slide scars (Bryn et al., 2005). They smooth the\nrough seabed created by the mass wasting processes and\nproduce thick sediment bodies with high water content,\nwhich generate excess pore pressure when rapidly loaded\nby glaciogenic sediment.

A slope may be made\nsusceptible to failure, due to excess pore pressure, because\nof its sedimentation history.\nUnder the conditions associated with a homogeneous\nsedimentary column, deposited at a constant rate with\nconstant porosity the sediments will compact, due to\nincreased gravity loading, and the pore ﬂuids will migrate\nup the column. The presence of faults and less permeable\nlayers will, however, alter the migration. Faults channel the\nﬂow (see Volpi et al., 2003). Less permeable layers initially\nprevent vertical passage, and create overpressure beneath\nthe cap, and then potentially also channel the ﬂow beneath\nthe cap creating a lateral ﬂow until a weakness in the\noverlying layer is found, when vertical migration can\nrecommence (see Fig. 1; and Orange and Breen, 1992;\nDugan and Flemings, 2000; Volpi et al., 2003).\nDiagenetic modiﬁcation of sediments may also increase\nsusceptibility to failure. Work by Volpi et al. (2003)\ninvestigating biogenic silica compaction demonstrates this.\nThe transformation of Opal-A to Opal-CT is associated\nwith a porosity reduction of \u000420%, consequently an\noverpressurised layer occurs beneath this diagenetic front.\nSeismic proﬁles provide evidence of ﬂuid vents rising from\nthis boundary, in addition to evidence of surface layer\ncreep (see Volpi et al., 2003).\nBacteria generate methane (biogenic) from the break-\ndown of organic-rich sediments deep in the sedimentary\ncolumn, this can migrate upwards to form clathrates,\nforming methane hydrate (see Mienert et al., 1998;\nDickens, 2003). Thermogenic methane may also migrate\nupwards\nin\nthe\nsedimentary\ncolumn.\nThe\nclathrates\nstrengthen the sediments but the free gas (a reservoir of\nwhich may form beneath the hydrate layer) will signiﬁ-\ncantly weaken the sediments increasing the likelihood of\nfailure (see Haq, 1998; Mienert et al., 1998; Sultan et al.,\n2004). Gas hydrates may only occur in high-pressure and\nlow-temperature regimes, an increase in temperature or a\nreduction in pressure can cause the hydrate bonds to\ndestabilise, releasing the caged-gas molecules (see Mienert\net al., 1998; Dickens, 2003) and reducing the strength of the\nsediment. Hence the development of gas hydrates will\nincrease the susceptibility of a slope to fail especially\nafter long periods of free gas accumulation beneath the\nhydrate layer and when environmental conditions change\nto destabilise the hydrate layer.\nAs well as the micro-scale (granular) it is also necessary\nto consider the meso- and macro-scales. During and since\nthe Miocene parts of the northwest Eurasian Plate have\nbeen subject to signiﬁcant uplift (Stoker et al., 1994). This,\nas well as, the increased erosion associated with the\nPlio–Pleistocene glacial cycles led to the development of\nmany fan complexes including the Barra, Donegal and",

Work by Fjeldskaar et al. (2000) reinforces this.\nThey predict the transition zone between uplift and\nsubsidence to be located just offshore western Norway, as\nthey note, the location where bending stress of the crust\nwill be greatest.\nSeismic triggers are deﬁned as any motion of the earth\n(see Wright and Rathje, 2003; Biscontin et al., 2004).\nAcceleration-induced sliding occurs when strong seismic\nmotions subject the sediments to horizontal and vertical\naccelerations, however, liquefaction-induced sliding occurs\nwhen cyclic shearing weakens the sediments (Wright and\nRathje, 2003). Seismic shaking will generate excess pore\npressure and it is possible for upward migrating pore ﬂuid\nto cause an instability beneath a region with a lower\ndissipation rate (Biscontin et al., 2004). Slope failure may\noccur several months after the seismic event because the\ntime required to reach critical conditions from different soil\nproﬁles range from minutes to months according to the\ncorresponding coefﬁcient of the consolidation proﬁle,\nwhich will inﬂuence the dissipation rate (see Wright and\nRathje, 2003; Biscontin et al., 2004).\nStorm wave, or tsunami, loading may also trigger\nfailures (see Jeng, 2001). Water waves generate adjacent\nzones of high- and low-pressure beneath crests and\ntroughs, shear stress is generated between these zones\n(Hampton et al., 1996). Tsunami wave fronts are capable\nof generating large hydrodynamic pressures on the seaﬂoor\nwith the potential to lead to failure (see Wright and Rathje,\n2003). An example is demonstrated by the work of Bea et\nal. (1983) in the Gulf of Mexico. Storm waves produced\nduring the passage of Hurricane Camille (August 1969)\ntriggered sediment failure to a depth of 30 m, lateral\nmovement exceeded 1000 m (see Bea et al., 1983). Other\nexamples of wave-induced sediment failure are discussed by\nJeng (2001). Storm occurrence is also controlled temporally\nby climate, in high latitudes by the movement of the polar\nfront and in low latitudes by the development of high-\naltitude zonal winds that tend to shear off hurricane\nsystems.\nRapid drawdown of water, for instance by the approach\nof a tsunami, removes the resisting forces exerted by the\nwater and induces undrained loading conditions, poten-\ntially causing failure (see Wright and Rathje, 2003). The\nSkagway slide and Fjord tsunami in Alaska (1994) seems to\nhave been initiated by an exceptionally low tide (see\nRabinovich et al., 1999).\nGas hydrate destabilisation can trigger slope failure.\nDistribution and stability of hydrates are controlled by:\ntemperature, pore pressure, gas composition and pore\nwater salinity (Kvenvolden, 1993, 1998). Any change in\nthese parameters may lead to the conversion of hydrate\ninto free gas plus water (see Sultan et al., 2004). This\nconversion reduces cohesive strength by removing hydrate",

Firstly, a reduction in pressure through a drop in sea\nlevel: it has frequently been argued that the sea level\nlowstand, associated with glacial conditions, could result in\ngas hydrate destabilisation, with the associated free gas\nrelease (see Nisbet, 1990; Haq, 1998; Kennett et al., 2003).\nSecondly, through an increase in ocean temperatures (as\nassociated with the deglaciation or warm interstadials)\ncausing destabilisation of the hydrate sediments (see\nKennett et al., 2003; Mienert et al., 2005). In either case\nmethane gas is released from the oxygen–hydrogen bonds\ncreating a weak layer in the sedimentary column.\nFailure may also be triggered by sediment deposition\nand the associated increase in pore pressure. For instance:\nvertical ﬂuid migration is initiated by sediment consolida-\ntion, a less permeable layer is encountered leading to high\npore pressure, eventually this ﬂuid maybe expelled by\nventing (see Volpi et al., 2003). This loading process has\nproduced a failure plane of reduced shear strength. As the\ndownslope force gradually increases failure could be\ntriggered, by the very gravimetric loading that has created\nthe failure surface, at the moment when the driving\ndownslope force exceeds the resisting shear strength (see\nHampton et al., 1996).\nDifferences in patterns of triggering events can be seen\nbetween the high and low latitudes. There is a relative\nabsence of postglacial seismicity in lower latitudes com-\npared to abundance in higher latitudes. In lower latitudes\nhurricane frequency and alterations in sedimentation\npatterns are more signiﬁcant trigger control mechanisms.\nCyclic variation in frequency and/or severity of trigger-\ning events may in itself produce particularly large failure\nevents. A low-triggering period allows time for build up of\nsusceptible sediment sequences that are then subjected to a\nperiod of high triggering event activity. This may explain\nthe comparative absence of large-scale mass movement\nevents on highly active margins, and locations (such as the\nMakran Margin of southwest Pakistan (see Prins and\nPostma, 2000), and the greater frequency of such events in\nless active locations (such as the Sindh margin, the North-\nwest European margin and the Amazon fan).",

They may also\ndetermine whether the developing failure becomes disin-\ntegrative, producing a disaggregated mass of sediment, or\nwhether much of the sediment remains as slabs of coherent\nsediment. Gas hydrate embedded within the latter is carried\ndown into deeper water and thus in general further into the\nstability ﬁeld of solid gas hydrate.\nThe principal mechanism of hydrocarbon release from\nsuch failures is therefore not from the cohesive sediment\nmasses themselves, but from uncapped reservoirs of free\ngas in the sediments below the failure plane and to a lesser\nextent from decompressed gas hydrates also originally\nlocated below the failure plane (known as the champagne\ncork effect).\nIn contrast, disintegrative slope failures (Hampton et al.,\n1996) typically develop into large-volume turbidity cur-\nrents or grain ﬂows. In such cases, while dense lithic grains\nsettle out as ocean ﬂoor deposits, low-density, buoyant\nhydrate clasts will tend to rise in the water column\nand ultimately ﬂoat upwards through the low-pressure\nlimit of hydrate stability and there decompose releasing\nmethane to the surface layers of the ocean or even directly\nto the atmosphere. On a small-scale, such ﬂoating may\ninvolve individual gas hydrate grains or nodules as\ndemonstrated experimentally by Paull et al. (2003). On a\nlarger scale in turbidity currents, buoyant gas hydrate\ngrains would tend to rise in the turbidity currents\nand perhaps even produce convective lift-off of the\nturbidity current once a sufﬁciently high fraction of the\nsediment grains had settled out, in the reverse process to\nthe rapid sinking of dense sediment laden plumes (Carey,\n1997).\nLarge-scale lift-off of buoyant plumes from turbidity\ncurrents, equivalent to the buoyant rise of hot ash clouds\nfrom pyroclastic ﬂows (Sparks et al., 1993), have been\ninferred from the characteristics of graded hemipelagic\nmud layers associated with the giant freshwater turbidites\nproduced by meltwater discharge ‘Heinrich’ events from\nthe Laurentian ice-sheet (Hesse et al., 2004). Association of\nsuch layers with disintegrative continental slope sediment\nfailures (as far as the authors are aware, these layers have\nnot yet been observed in conjunction with continental slope\nfailure deposits) would provide direct evidence of escape of\nbuoyant plumes from such failures and, therefore, plausible\nevidence for gas hydrate release.",

        "text": "The magnitude of a tsunami generated by a submarine\nmass movement is dependent on the initial volume of the\nmass movement, seaﬂoor geometry, the cohesion of the\ndisplaced mass, acceleration and velocity of the mass\nmovement (Locat et al., 2004). The sediment type is also an\nimportant consideration: stiff clays will convert more of the\nmass movement’s energy into tsunami energy, and are thus\nmore likely to produce a tsunami than less dense, less\ncompacted and more heterogeneous sediments (Tappin\net al., 2001).\nAs with gas hydrate release, whether or not the mass\nmovement is disintegrative or cohesive is a very important\nfactor in tsunami generation. The more disintegrative the\nmass movement the less efﬁcient it will be at displacing\nwater and generating a wave front (see Tappin et al., 2001;\nGaragesh et al., 2003; Locat et al., 2004). However, a\ncohesive slide mass may not travel as fast as a disinte-\ngrative one. There is a tradeoff between cohesion of the\nsliding block and its basal friction, hence the velocity that it\ncan attain. The true impact of the tsunami will not simply\nbe a function of its size, but also of the region where it\nimpacts. A large tsunami impacting on an uninhabited\ncoastline will have a less severe impact than a smaller\ntsunami impacting on a densely inhabited coastline. As\npreviously mentioned, tsunamis may have the additional\neffect of triggering submarine slope failures, and poten-\ntially generating more tsunamis.",

The ﬁrst stage was the development of a\ndatabase of well dated North Atlantic sector large-scale\nsubmarine mass movements for the last 45 ka, ﬁrst\npresented by Maslin et al. (2004).\nThe relationships between mass movements and CH4,\nglacial cycles, and local and global sea level are discussed.\nSeveral ﬁelds are incorporated in the mass movement\ndatabase and Table 1 summarises these and the reason for\ntheir inclusion.\nThe dataset produced using these methods consists, at its\nmost basic, of timing and volume/mass of mass movements\nduring the past 45 ka. Exact age determination is vital; an\nerror of a thousand years may make the difference between\nrising and falling sea level, or a CH4 peak or trough. We\nhave developed a reliability index to examine the possible\neffect of these errors. The reliability index (see Table 1) is\nnot attempting to grade any research; rather it reﬂects the\ndifﬁculty of dating a particular mass movement emplace-\nment. For example dating a megaturbidite, in a basin plain\nwhere sedimentation rates are known is a great deal more\nstraightforward to date than a debris ﬂow in a river fan\nthat has been subjected to erosion during periods in its\nhistory. The reliability index is a ﬁve-point scale as follows:\n(1) excellent reliability, (2) good reliability, (3) average\nreliability, (4) mediocre reliability and (5) poor reliability.",

(1999).\nMany problems are encountered when dating submarine\nmass movements, as demonstrated in Fig. 2. The most\nreliable method for determining emplacement dates, during\nthe last 45 ka, is AMS\n14C dating pelagic sediment\nimmediately above the deposit, as this should have been\ndeposited immediately after emplacement. Material below\nthe deposit will include reworked older material and the\ndeposit itself will consist of sediment deposited prior to\nfailure. It is not always possible to obtain dates from\nimmediately above the deposit. In some instances timings\nare ascertained through extrapolations from sedimentation\nrates; but it should be noted that these are not always\ncontinuous.\nMoreover,\nthe\nhemipelagic\nsedimentation\nabove the slide maybe so rapid as to not contain enough\ndateable ‘‘pelagic’’ material. Alternatively, where a mass\nmovement from shallow water is emplaced in much deeper\nwater it may be preferable to pick abyssal-depth dwelling\nbenthic\nforaminifera\nto\ndate,\nin\norder\nto\neliminate\ncontamination of the dated samples from slide material\n(which should not contain the abyssal dwelling species).\nThe effect of bioturbation on AMS 14C dates can lead to\nsubstantial error. Benthic organisms are known to burrow\nup to 10 cm into the ocean sediments (Loubere et al., 1995),\nthis means that sediments of different ages can be mixed\nand in areas of low sedimentation rates, dating accuracy\ngreatly reduced. Where a mass transport deposit has a low\ncarbonate content there will be unequal bioturbation, as\nlittle carbonate is available to be mixed upwards and this\nyounger material will be preferentially moved downwards,",

Trænadjupet\nOn the continental slope east and northeast of the\nVøring plateau in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea Trænad-\njupet is a large translational slide (Laberg and Vorren,\n2000; Laberg et al., 2002). Slide scar area is approximately\n5000 km2 and the deposits have been estimated at 900 km3,\nassuming an average thickness of 100 m (Laberg et al.,\n2002). Timing of the event is based on AMS 14C dates from\ntwo cores taken from within the scar. Sampling of\nNeogloboquadrina pachyderma indicates that pelagic sedi-\nmentation resumed in the slide scar from 4 ka AMS 14C BP\n(Laberg et al., 2002). This indicates that the event occurred\nimmediately prior to this time postdeglaciation during the\nmid-Holocene\n(corresponding\nto\na\ncalendar\ndate\nof\n4 ka BP). from the presence of large blocks and rafts of\nsediment Laberg and Vorren (2000) argue that failure\noccurred along surfaces of weakness: most likely inter-\nglacial, contouritic, muds possessing relatively high water\ncontent and low undrained shear strength. High clay and\norganic content could lead to excess pore pressure and\nmethane (Laberg and Vorren, 2000). Through geotechnical\ntests Sultan et al. (2004) established that the contouritic\nsediments, in which the main failure occurred (Laberg\net al., 2003), were particularly weak in undrained condi-\ntions appropriate to cohesive failure. Sediment stability\nwould be reduced along these bedding planes and potential\nfor failure increased. Trænadjupet is situated in an area of\nrapid postglacial fennoscandinavian uplift and high in-\ntraplate seismicity (Laberg and Vorren. 2000; Laberg et al.,\n2000; Fjeldskaar et al., 2000). Martinussen (1961) andøya\nsea level curve (see Fig. 4a and Fig. 5) demonstrates that\nrebound is occurring at this time. An earthquake, or\nsuccession of small earthquakes, is cited by Laberg and\nVorren (2000) as the most likely trigger mechanism.\nDeglacial sedimentation and isostatic slope steepening\nwould have made the slope more susceptible to failure;\nan earthquake would have increased the sediment shear\nstress causing it to fail along the planes of weakness.",

With\nthe discovery and subsequent development of the Ormen\nLange gas ﬁeld this area has been subject to intense\nresearch during recent years. The role of gas hydrates is\nviewed, at most, as a secondary process: no sign of\nclathrates have been found in the area’s boreholes though\nsome BSRS have been identiﬁed (Kvalstad et al., 2005;\nMienert et al., 2005). A greater emphasis is placed on the\nrole of glacial sediment loading of the North Sea fan and\npore\nwater\nmigration\nto,\nand\nsediment\nswelling\nof\ncontouritic marine clays in the distal regions of the\nstoregga slide (see Bryn et al., 2005; Kvalstad et al.,\n2005). An earthquake is widely regarded as the most likely\ninitial trigger. Research on onshore postglacial faults\nindicates a magnitude 7 earthquake approximately every\n1.1 ka (Bungum et al., 2005). This is postdeglaciation\nduring a period of massive rebound (see Fig. 5) and it is\nlikely that rapid sedimentation and isostatic slope steepen-\ning would have increased susceptibility to failure. This\nregion could also be subject to enhanced seismicity from\na deglacial seismic pulse migrating from the former\nforebulge of the Fennoscandian ice-sheet (see Fjeldskaar\net al., 2000).",

This pattern is\nexplained by the isostatic curve in Fig. 5. At \u000411 ka\ncalendar years BP isostatic change appears to be very low,\nmost likely a result of the Younger Dryas re-glaciation.\nThe rate increases to \u00047 m ka\u00021 at 10 ka calendar years BP.\nIsostatic uplift peaks in the period 8–9 ka calendar years BP\nat \u000421 m ka\u00021, a result of rapid rebound shortly after the\nﬁnal deglaciation.

Between 6 and 7 ka calendar years BP the rate\nincreases slightly, to \u000415 m ka\u00021, after which the rate\ndecreases steadily until 3 ka calendar years BP when it\nreaches late Holocene values of \u00041 m ka\u00021.\nAt Frøya (see Svendsen and Mangerud, 1987) sea level\nrises steadily until 11 ka calendar years BP, the rate of rise\nthen increases until shortly after 10 ka calendar years BP.\nThere then follows a period of declining sea level until\n\u00047.5 ka calendar years BP, from which point there is a slow\nrise in sea levels to the present. Fig. 5 shows a decline in the\nrate of isostatic rise from 12.5 ka calendar years BP.\nBetween 11.5 and 9.5 ka calendar years BP this decline\nbecomes a pronounced negative spike (to \u000219 m ka\u00021).

Situated offshore Norway,\non the boundary between the ice sheet and the forebulge\nregion, during the deglaciation and the early Holocene the\narea would be subject to high rates of crustal stresses\nand increased seismic activity (Fjeldskaar et al., 2000;\nMuir-Wood, 2000). It seems likely that, occurring at this\ntime in this location, the Andøya mass movement was\ncaused by the continental slopes being overloaded by\nsediment during the deglaciation and the triggering of this\nunstable mass by an isostatic earthquake in a period of,\npostdeglaciation, heightened seismic activity. Faulting of\nthe continental margin due to continental rebound is also a\npossible cause (Andøya is situated on the steepest section\nof the Norwegian-Greenland sea margin with current\nangles between 51 and 181 (Vorren et al., 1998)). However,\na fall in local relative sea level coupled with a rise in sea\nwater temperature of 5 1C (see Birks and Koc-, 2002) would\nhave made free gas release from hydrates more probable\nand it is possible that they played a role.\nThis isostatic data, combined with the research con-\nducted on the Ormen Lange ﬁeld, presents an even stronger\nargument for an earthquake or some form of crustal\nwarping, related faulting, triggering Storrega. The failure\noccurred at 8.1 ka calendar years BP (see Haﬂidason et al.,\n2004, 2005), Fig. 5 demonstrates that this is immediately\nafter\nthe\nperiod\nwith\nthe\ngreatest\nrate\nof\nuplift\n(420 m ka\u00021), at this time uplift is still 410 m ka\u00021 at\nFrøya, close to the Storegga slide scar. The event’s\noccurrence\nwould seem\nto be related to postglacial\nenvironmental change: rapid sedimentation (and associated\nincreasing pore pressure) due to the retreat of the\nFennoscandinavian ice-sheet, an increase in seismic activ-\nity, isostatic-induced slope steepening and potential clath-\nrate destabilisation through warming ocean temperatures.\nTrænadjupet occurs, after the local eustatic rise resumes,\nat 4 ka calendar years BP. Isostatic rebound was still taking\nplace, as noted by Laberg and Vorren (2000) but, as shown\nin Fig. 5, at a reduced rate. This event is possibly an\nexample of a slope made susceptible to failure during the\ndeglacial environment and then triggered several ka later.\nIt has been argued, based on studies of onshore faults and\nhistorical records (see Bungum et al., 2005), that the\nrecurrence time of a Magnitude 7 earthquake on the\nNorwegian margin is currently approximately 1.1 ka. If\nsuch an event occurred in close proximity to the slide area\nit is quite probable that it would have triggered the event if\nthe slopes were already loaded with unstable sediments.\nWhilst there is no direct evidence of seismicity occurring\noffshore\nNorway\nduring\nthe\ndeglaciation\nand\nearly\nHolocene, work by Mo¨ rner et al. (2000) documents a\nsuspected Magnitude 8 earthquake in the Iggesund-\nHudiksvall area of Sweden, as well as several other\nmagnitude 7 and 8 events occurring in the deglaciation\nand Holocene, indicating that during this period Fennos-\ncandia was seismically active.",

        "text": "Reinforcing the role of the deglacial environment in\nfacilitating the generation of sedimentary failure, Vanneste\net al. (2006) document a large (1350 km3) mass movement\non the northern Svalbard margin: the Hinlopen slide.\nTiming of the event is not yet known, however, based on\ngeophysical data the authors state that the event is recent,\nbut no later than deglaciation. It seems likely that as more\nmargins are surveyed, and more mass movement events\ndocumented, that further evidence for deglacial mass\nmovements will be presented.\nWhen predicting future mass movements on the degla-\nciating margins of Greenland and Antarctica it is in-\nappropriate to do so with reference to global sea level.\nFig. 4 demonstrates very clearly the need to consider local\nfactors such as relative sea level and local sedimentation\npatterns.\nAt lower latitude, non-glaciated, margins the McGuire\net al. (1997) sea level curve is appropriate. Fig. 6 shows\nmass movements associated with such margins, mass\nmovements from the northeastern American margin have\nbeen omitted because of the inﬂuence of the Laurentian ice-\nsheet. Three events are associated with the deglaciation\nbetween 15 and 11.5 ka calendar years BP. Four events\noccur at regular intervals between 22 and 43.5 ka calendar\nyears BP. The other event occurs either at, or just after, the\nLGM.\nThe Amazon Fan events provide a good case study of\nthe low latitude situation (see Piper et al., 1997; Maslin and\nMikkelsen, 1997; Maslin et al., 1998, 2005; Maslin and\nBurns, 2000). The western and eastern debris ﬂows\noccurred during the deglaciation (Maslin et al., 1998,\n2005). Deglaciation of the Andes and increased continental\nwetness caused a massive increase in Amazon sediment\ndischarge (Maslin et al., 1998; Maslin and Burns, 2000;\nMaslin et al., 2005). The rising sea level shifted the\ndeposition centre towards the upper continental slope\nand the Amazon fan, possibly causing overburdening and\nfailure (Maslin et al., 1998, 2005). The deep events occurred\nearlier during periods of rapidly falling sea level (15–25\nm/ka\u00021). This lower sea level would have increased the\nsusceptibility of the slope to failure.

The combined effects of isostasy\nand eustasy inﬂuence local sea level, which affects gas\nhydrates, sediment deposition and erosion. Stochastic\nfactors (such as non-isostatic earthquakes) also inﬂuence\nthe triggers.\nDuring the deglaciation (Fig. 7b) high-latitude regions\nexperience the collapse of the continental ice-mass. This\ninﬂuences sediment deposition (huge, rapid increase in\nglaciogenic followed by a return to pelagic (see Dowdeswell\nand Elverhøi, 2002)), eustatic sea level (rising), isostasy\n(rebound of depressed continental crust), seismics (pulse of\nhigh seisimicity in the forebulge region (Fjeldskaar et al.,\n2000; Muir-Wood, 2000; Bungum et al., 2005)) and an\nincrease in ocean temperatures (\u00045 1C in the eastern\nnorwegian sea during the Holocene transition (Birks and\nKoc-, 2002)). The rate of isostatic uplift experienced on\nsome of these margins means that depth of water (and\nhence pressure) does not increase at the same rate as\nseawater temperature. This increases the likelihood of\ndestabilised gas hydrates. Rapid sedimentation, release of\nisostatic forces, an upsurge of seismicity and gas release\nfrom hydrates increase stresses operating on the continen-\ntal margins. High-latitude margins are relatively stable\nduring\nthe\nglaciation\nand\nrelatively\nunstable\nduring\ndeglaciation. In high latitudes during deglaciation local\nrelative sea level will bare little resemblance to mean global\nrelative sea level (see Fig. 4) and, therefore, may have\nconsiderable inﬂuence on slope stability.\nDuring the glaciation (see Fig. 7a) low-latitude regions\nexperience a fall in ocean temperature and relative sea level,\nas the ice-mass increases in the high latitudes: inﬂuencing\nsediment deposition (change of deposition centre, see\nMaslin et al., 1998, 2005). Trigger mechanisms are,\ntherefore, also inﬂuenced. Gas hydrates are destabilised\nby falling sea level but stabilised by cooling temperatures,\nalthough temperatures are not reduced to the same degree\nas in the higher latitudes. A difference in sea surface\ntemperatures of 1.2 1C between the glacial and Holocene is\nreconstructed by Billups and Spero (1996) for the western\nequatorial atlantic ocean. the gas hydrate stability zone will\nbe reduced during glacial periods in low latitudes. Change\nin sediment deposition can lead to overburdening through\nincreasing pore pressures (see Dugan and Flemings, 2000;\nBiscontin et al., 2004; Strout and Tjelta, 2005).\nDuring the deglaciation (see Fig. 7b) low latitude regions\nexperience a eustatic rise in relative global sea levels due to\nthe melting of the high-latitude ice-mass, sediment deposi-\ntion will increase due to melting of glaciers in mountains\n(e.g. Andes and Himalaya) and increased continental\nwetness (see Maslin et al., 1998; Maslin and Burns, 2000).\nGas hydrates will be destabilised by increasing ocean\ntemperatures but stabilised by rising eustatic sea level.\nSediment failure is likely to occur due to sediment\noverburdening resulting from increased rates of sedimenta-\ntion and shifting deposition centres.

        "text": "This paper demonstrates that Late Pleistocene North\nAtlantic submarine mass movements have been inﬂuenced\nby climatic change through a combination of isostatic and\nsedimentary\nprocesses\nassociated\nwith\nthe\noscillating\nrelative sea level. Certain slopes are predisposed to failure\nbecause of their sedimentary structure and geological\nhistory.\nA clear latitudinal zoning exists in the causes of\nsubmarine mass movements through the past 45 ka. In\nthe high latitudes during deglaciations, through increased\nsedimentation, increased ocean temperatures and the\nrelease of isostatic energy: increasing the susceptibility of\nslopes to failure due to isostatic/seismic triggers. In the low\nlatitudes lowered sea relative levels during the glacial\nincrease\nthe\nprobability\nof\nfailure\ndue\nto\ncalthrate\ndestabilisation and free gas release (Nisbet, 1990; Haq,\n1998; Kennett et al., 2003) and during the deglacial\nincreased sedimentation and changes in deposition centres\nincrease the likelihood of failure due to overburdening of\nthe sedimentary column (see Maslin et al., 1998, 2005).\nDeglacial submarine mass movements are associated with\nthe early Holocene methane peak.\nClimate driven environmental change (with associated\nchanges in local and global relative sea level, sedimentation\nand isostatic seismicity) is likely to initiate submarine mass\nmovement in the same way as it has in the past. Glacial\nretreat in Antarctica (see Cook et al., 2005) and Greenland\n(see Howat et al., 2005; Velicogna and Wahr, 2006) will\nincrease the likelihood of sedimentary failure and mass\nmovements (with their associated impacts of tsunamis and\nCH4 release) occurring in these locations.",
