When you first heard of the term convolutional neural networks, you may have thought of\nsomething related to neuroscience or biology, and you would be right. Sort of. CNNs do take a biological inspiration from the\nvisual cortex. The visual cortex has small regions of cells that are sensitive to specific regions of the visual field. This idea was\nexpanded upon by a fascinating experiment by Hubel and Wiesel in 1962 (Video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?\nv=Cw5PKV9Rj3o)) where they showed that some individual neuronal cells in the brain responded (or fired) only in the presence\nof edges of a certain orientation. For example, some neurons fired when exposed to vertical edges and some when shown\nhorizontal or diagonal edges. Hubel and Wiesel found out that all of these neurons were organized in a columnar architecture and\nthat together, they were able to produce visual perception. This idea of specialized components inside of a system having specific\ntasks (the neuronal cells in the visual cortex looking for specific characteristics) is one that machines use as well, and is the basis\nbehind CNNs.",

A very important note is that the depth of this filter has to be the same as the depth of the input (this makes sure\nthat the math works out), so the dimensions of this filter is 5 x 5 x 3. Now, let’s take the first position the filter is in for example.  It\nwould be the top left corner. As the filter is sliding, or convolving, around the input image, it is multiplying the values in the filter\nwith the original pixel values of the image (aka computing element wise multiplications). These multiplications are all summed\nup (mathematically speaking, this would be 75 multiplications in total). So now you have a single number. Remember, this\nnumber is just representative of when the filter is at the top left of the image. Now, we repeat this process for every location on\nthe input volume. (Next step would be moving the filter to the right by 1 unit, then right again by 1, and so on). Every unique\nlocation on the input volume produces a number. After sliding the filter over all the locations, you will find out that what you’re left\nwith is a 28 x 28 x 1 array of numbers, which we call an activation map or feature map. The reason you get a 28 x 28 array is\nthat there are 784 different locations that a 5 x 5 filter can fit on a 32 x 32 input image. These 784 numbers are mapped to a 28 x\n28 array.",

We talked about what the filters in the first conv layer are designed to detect. They detect low level features\nsuch as edges and curves. As one would imagine, in order to predict whether an image is a type of object, we need the network\nto be able to recognize higher level features such as hands or paws or ears. So let’s think about what the output of the network is\nafter the first conv layer. It would be a 28 x 28 x 3 volume (assuming we use three 5 x 5 x 3 filters).  When we go through another\nconv layer, the output of the first conv layer becomes the input of the 2\n conv layer.  Now, this is a little bit harder to visualize.\nWhen we were talking about the first layer, the input was just the original image. However, when we’re talking about the 2\n conv\nlayer, the input is the activation map(s) that result from the first layer. So each layer of the input is basically describing the\nlocations in the original image for where certain low level features appear. Now when you apply a set of filters on top of that (pass\nit through the 2\n conv layer), the output will be activations that represent higher level features. Types of these features could be\nsemicircles (combination of a curve and straight edge) or squares (combination of several straight edges). As you go through the\nnetwork and go through more conv layers, you get activation maps that represent more and more complex features. By the end\nof the network, you may have some filters that activate when there is handwriting in the image, filters that activate when they see\npink objects, etc. If you want more information about visualizing filters in ConvNets, Matt Zeiler and Rob Fergus had an excellent\nresearch paper (https://cs.nyu.edu/~fergus/papers/zeilerECCV2014.pdf) discussing the topic. Jason Yosinski also has a video\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgkfIQ4IGaM) on YouTube that provides a great visual representation. Another interesting\nthing to note is that as you go deeper into the network, the filters begin to have a larger and larger receptive field, which means\nthat they are able to consider information from a larger area of the original input volume (another way of putting it is that they are\nmore responsive to a larger region of pixel space).",

        "text": "Now that we can detect these high level features, the icing on the cake is attaching a fully connected layer to the end\nof the network. This layer basically takes an input volume (whatever the output is of the conv or ReLU or pool layer preceding it)\nand outputs an N dimensional vector where N is the number of classes that the program has to choose from. For example, if you\nwanted a digit classification program, N would be 10 since there are 10 digits. Each number in this N dimensional vector\nrepresents the probability of a certain class. For example, if the resulting vector for a digit classification program is [0 .1 .1 .75 0 0\n0 0 0 .05], then this represents a 10% probability that the image is a 1, a 10% probability that the image is a 2, a 75% probability\nthat the image is a 3, and a 5% probability that the image is a 9 (Side note: There are other ways that you can represent the\noutput, but I am just showing the softmax approach). The way this fully connected layer works is that it looks at the output of the\nprevious layer (which as we remember should represent the activation maps of high level features) and determines which\nfeatures most correlate to a particular class. For example, if the program is predicting that some image is a dog, it will have high\nvalues in the activation maps that represent high level features like a paw or 4 legs, etc. Similarly, if the program is predicting that\nsome image is a bird, it will have high values in the activation maps that represent high level features like wings or a beak, etc.",

During the forward pass, you take a training image which as we remember is a 32 x 32 x 3 array of numbers and\npass it through the whole network. On our first training example, since all of the weights or filter values were randomly initialized,\nthe output will probably be something like [.1 .1 .1 .1 .1 .1 .1 .1 .1 .1], basically an output that doesn’t give preference to any\nnumber in particular. The network, with its current weights, isn’t able to look for those low level features or thus isn’t able to make\nany reasonable conclusion about what the classification might be. This goes to the loss function part of backpropagation.\nRemember that what we are using right now is training data. This data has both an image and a label.

Let's consider the depth and suppose we have two\nconvolution layer L1 and L2. Output of L1 is input to L2. Lets say output size of L1 is 20*20*10 i.e there are 10 filters in layer L1. Now a filter in L2\nwill extract feature by reading area 5*5 (lets say) in one dimension i.e along depth in total it will read 5*5*10 area. Am I right ?",

Therefore, there can't really be an answer to your question of \"How are those 5\nfilters trained on our 10 classes\". It depends on the training examples you have and the stochastic nature of batch gradient\ndescent. The general understanding is that the X number of filters will \"learn\" (adjust their weights) such that we get a more\naccurate model. I don't think it's accurate to say that one of the filters will exactly correspond to one class, it's more of an\naggregated effect that comes with all the filters + fully connected weights at the end. As for your last question, it would get\nhigh activations wherever the curve is present (not necessarily a rat). The filters at the lower levels are detecting a particular\nshape/feature rather than a class, so yes even if you give it a non-rat image, you still may see a high activation if there are\ncurves in the image.",

F1 is being trained for\ndetecting curve edges and F2 is being trained for detecting horizontal straight lines. Now at training time weights will be updated for\nfilters F1 and F2( suppose we are using Gradientdescent for updating weights). Now my question is that how Gradientdescent will\ncome to know that it has to update weights for F1 to detect curve edges not horizontal lines and updated weights for F2 to detect\nhorizontal lines not curve edges.",

A followup qn on the same topic - so since the\nadjustment happens by the system itself, and we don't have any interference on the weights, it might even happen that that\nmultiple filters might be adjusted to detect the same thing right? I mean MIGHT happen case...\nSo its all pure luck - basically a very rare scenario that multiple filters are detecting/filtering the same thing. Am i right?\n△\n▽",
