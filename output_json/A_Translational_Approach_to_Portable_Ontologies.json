Definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus\nare translated by a system called Ontolingua into specialized representations, including\nframe-based systems as well as relational languages.  This allows researchers to share\nand reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized\nimplementations.\nWe discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical\nproblems.  One problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational\ndifferences among representations while preserving declarative content.  Another is how\nto translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining\nsystem-independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented\nsystems.  We describe how these problems are addressed by basing Ontolingua itself on\nan ontology of domain-independent, representational idioms.",

It would be relatively simple to write translators into CycL\n(Lenat & Guha, 1990), KEE (Fikes & Kehler, 1985), or EXPRESS (Spiby, 1991).  Ontolingua can\nparse arbitrary KIF sentences, and recognizes many common representation idioms.  However,\nnot all KIF sentences can be translated into all target representation systems.  When\ndefinitions contain sentences that cannot be translated into a given implementation,\nOntolingua informs the user and continues.",

However, the KEE frame system is less expressive than Loom\nand the logic-based languages.  Consequently, a constraint that would be said declaratively in\nLoom might be implemented with an attached procedure in KEE.  For instance, the KEE frame\nbrowser shows a template for the slot person.name “inherited” from the superclass person,\nbut it does not have a constraint language capable of expressing the fact that the value of the\nauthor.name slot is the same as the value of the person.name slot.  To implement this\nconstraint, one would write an attached procedure that computes the value of one of the slots\nfrom the other if either is given a value.  The existence of embedded procedural code in object-\noriented systems such as KEE is one reason for maintaining ontologies in a more expressive,\ndeclarative language, and translating into the restricted languages.  The assumption is that it is\neasier to generate procedural code to implement a declarative specification than to infer the\ndeclarative semantics from a procedure.",

One of the\nmotivations for trying to make ontologies portable over several implementations of\nrepresentation systems, rather than just standardizing on one system, is that different systems\nprovide different computational services at different costs.  The translation strategy allows one\nto use some computational services at conceptual design time (e.g., terminological\nclassification, general-purpose inference) and to use the same ontology for the development of\nproduction systems (e.g., translating it into object-oriented class definitions or database\nschemata).  It is important to note that Ontolingua does not support query processing; users\ncall implemented systems directly to invoke inference procedures.  This lessens the need to\nwrite ontologies in a special-purpose language, because many of the compromises made in the\nexpressiveness of a representation are made to optimize run-time inference.",

In configuration design, however, the set of relevant parameters\nand constraints is a function of the components chosen.  The specification of a particular design task, such as\nthe VT task for designing an elevator, is the description of a system component like an elevator, a set of\nconstraints on that component (e.g., customer requirements), and a library of background constraints (e.g.,\nlaws of physics) and available components.  A valid design is a complete description of the system component,\nwith values for relevant parameters and choices for subcomponents, that satisfies all the constraints.    The\ndefinitions in this ontology embody this tight relationship between components, constraints, and parameters.\nConstraints are defined as unary predicates that hold for components.  Parameters are unary functions on\ncomponents.  Components are related to other components through binary subpart relations.\")",
