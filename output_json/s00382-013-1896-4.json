This is the extent to which a single\nmodel can produce different projections, all consistent with\ncurrent observations, through changing the values of the\nparameters in the model. This includes the uncertainty\npresent due to the fact that we cannot observe the model\noutput for every, or indeed for very many, choices of the\nparameters of the model.\nQuantifying the parametric uncertainty in a particular\nclimate model has drawn some attention in the climate\ncommunity in recent years (Murphy et al. 2004; Collins\net al. 2011). This uncertainty must be addressed using\nperturbed physics ensembles (PPE), where the parameters\nof a model are all varied in a systematic way and where the\nmodel is run at each of these designed settings. We treat the\nPPE as a sparse sample of behaviours from a vast, high\ndimensional parameter space. The PPE is used to inform us\nabout the behaviour of the model in this space and, in\nparticular, about regions of the space where model-based\nprojections are not predicted to be inconsistent with current\nobservations.\nIn this paper we illustrate the application of existing\nmethodology from the statistics with computer experiments\nliterature to rule out regions of the parameter space of the\nUK Met Ofﬁce’s Third Hadley Centre Ocean–Atmosphere\nGeneral Circulation Model (HadCM3) (Pope et al. 2000;\nGordon et al. 2000) containing model runs that are\ninconsistent with a handful of physically important obser-\nvational metrics. In particular, we use emulators, (fast\nstatistical representations of climate models that include a\nmeasure of uncertainty in the prediction of climate model\noutput), and four pre-industrial global and hemispheric\naverages of climatic variables to remove over half of the\nexplored space. We ﬁnd that of the constraints chosen,\nglobal mean surface air temperature (SAT) is the dominant\nconstraint and that the other chosen metrics barely reduce\nthe space further.\nWe show that the behaviour of more complex climate\nvariables, such as time series of the Atlantic Meridional\nOverturning Current (AMOC) is easier to capture with\nemulators in the reduced space than prior to the application\nof history matching. We also show that perceived rela-\ntionships between climate variables, such as the Meridional\nHeat Transport (MHT) and the AMOC, do not necessarily\nhold in the full parameter space, but do in the constrained\nparameter space. We show that the response of the AMOC\nand the MHT to CO2 forcing is greater in the constrained\nparameter space. We argue that because of these issues,\nhistory matching is an important pre-cursor to any analysis\nof a complex climate model with a PPE.\nWe analyse the shape of the constrained parameter space\nof HadCM3 in the form of 2 dimensional projections.

However,\nwe also ﬁnd that the other parameters are important and can\nbe set so that no single value of entcoef automatically leads\nto climates that do not match our chosen observational\nmetrics. We explore parts of HadCM3’s parameter space\npreviously unstudied by running models with parameter\nchoices outside the ranges established by Murphy et al.\n(2004). We ﬁnd many runs in this extended parameter\nspace that are not inconsistent with our observational\nmetrics.\nIn any study where a climate model is combined with\nobservations or used to make inferences about reality, it is\nimportant to acknowledge and give a careful treatment of\nmodel discrepancy, the extent to which missing processes\nand approximations in the model affect its ability to inform\nus about the true climate system (Goldstein and Rougier\n2004; Sexton et al. 2011; Kennedy and O’Hagan 2001). As\nwe are uncertain about model discrepancy we treat it as a\nrandom quantity within the Bayesian paradigm, where\nuncertainty for a collection of random quantities is a rep-\nresentation of our subjective beliefs about the collection\nrather than an actual property of it (see, for example, de\nFinetti 1974). An estimate for the variance of the model\ndiscrepancy is a key requirement for history matching. We\ndiscuss this issue and derive an estimate for it under an\ninterpretation of model discrepancy variance as a tolerance\nto climate model error, using a multi-model ensemble for\nthe World Climate Research Programme’s Coupled Model\nIntercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) (Meehl et al.\n2007).\nIn Sect. 2 we describe current methods for using a PPE\nto assess parametric uncertainty of a climate model and\nintroduce history matching as an alternative. Section 3\ndescribes our ensemble, the observational constraints used,\nand the emulators of those constraints in HadCM3 built for\nthis analysis. In Sect. 4 we use CMIP3 to derive model\ndiscrepancy for HadCM3 in order to facilitate history\nmatching. In Sects. 5 and 6 we present the results of the\nhistory match and explore the ‘‘not ruled out yet’’ region of\nparameter space in HadCM3. Section 7 contains discus-\nsion. Appendices A–C contains details about the parameter\nspace of HadCM3, our emulators and a more technical\nderivation and discussion regarding the model discrepancy.",

One has been to\ntreat the ensemble as a representative collection of the\npossible behaviours of the climate model and to do any\nanalysis on the ensemble itself. The other is the Bayesian\napproach, which we describe later.\nThe ﬁrst step, under the ﬁrst approach, is to screen out\nensemble members that differ markedly from historical\nobservations. This is called ensemble ﬁltering. Some met-\nric of comparison with observed climate is deﬁned by the\nanalyst, and models some tolerance away from the obser-\nvations are discarded. Rowlands et al. (2012), for example,\nﬁrst discard any ensemble member that requires a global\nannual mean ﬂux adjustment of absolute magnitude greater\nthan 5 W m-2.\nThe next step under this approach is to choose a metric\nwith which to weight each ensemble member so that the\nweighted ensemble represents parametric uncertainty. For\nexample, Rowlands et al. (2012) deﬁne a ‘likely’ set of\nensemble members within the sub-ensemble of not-dis-\ncarded runs based on a selecting those sub-ensemble\nmembers below the 66th percentile of a weighted mean\nsquared error that they compute. Murphy et al. (2004) also\ndeﬁne a reliability metric which they call the Climate\nPrediction Index (CPI) and use it to weight each ensemble\nmember according to an estimated relative likelihood that\nthey will correctly predict climate change in the real world.\nThe issue with this approach is that it does not account\nfor the uncertainty in the unsampled, high dimensional\nparameter space. Speciﬁcally, for any parameter choice at\nwhich we have not yet run the climate model, we are\nuncertain as to what the model climate will look like. By\nﬁltering the ensemble, important information about the\nparameter space, both at the locations of the ﬁltered runs\nand in a neighbourhood around them, is discarded without\nbeing used. That information could be used to update our\nbeliefs about the behaviour of the model climate in those\nparts of parameter space. By weighting individual mem-\nbers, the fact that there may be very many other projections\nwithin the unsampled regions of parameter space that are\nconsistent with the observations and inconsistent with the\nset of future projections currently in the ensemble, is\nignored.\nThe Bayesian approach uses the PPE to learn about the\nbehaviour of the model throughout its parameter space in",

We\ndescribe this in 2.3 and the process applied to climate\nmodels is described by Rougier (2007). Bayesian methods\nhave gained increasing attention in the study of climate\nmodels (for example Berliner and Kim 2008; Furrer et al.\n2007), and a Bayesian calibration provided the UK Climate\nProjections (Murphy et al. 2009; Sexton et al. 2011).\nBayesian calibration requires a stochastic representation\nof the climate model, called an emulator (Sacks et al.\n1989), to be constructed and to be reliable across the whole\nof parameter space. This may require highly sophisticated\nstatistical models that accurately capture those behaviours\nwe are interested in whilst simultaneously capturing\nextremely unphysical behaviours and irrelevant extremes.\nWhen the size of a perturbed physics ensemble is restricted\nby computational resources, this requirement will often\nmean spending a large proportion of our budget of model\nruns on exploring parameter space we already know to be\nunphysical and a signiﬁcant proportion of our effort in\nmodelling these irrelevant behaviours.\nAnother potential problem with Bayesian calibration\noccurs because the calculation implies that there must be\nsome region of parameter space with positive probability of\ncontaining the best input. However, there could be no\nregions of parameter space that contain climates that match\nobservations to the accuracy required considering all rele-\nvant uncertainties. If we calibrate without some form of\npreliminary analysis to check that the parameter space\ncontains settings that lead to climates consistent with cur-\nrent observations, the results of a Bayesian calibration\ncould be meaningless.

However, probability need not be used.\nWe may choose instead to make expectation statements\ndirectly, based on the fundamental work of de Finetti\n(1974, 1975). de Finetti provides a rigorous and operational\ndevelopment in which expectation (termed ‘‘prevision’’ by\nde Finetti) is the primitive quantity that may be speciﬁed\ndirectly, and the probability of any event is identiﬁed with\nthe expectation for the indicator function for that event (an\nindicator function is 1 if the event occurs and 0 otherwise).\nThis approach is valuable in problems which are sufﬁ-\nciently complex that we are unable or unwilling ﬁrst to\nmake a full joint probability speciﬁcation over the space of\npossibilities. Such considerations are of particular impor-\ntance when dealing with high dimensional computer\nmodels for complex physical processes, and many of the\nreferences in this paper describe analyses carried out within\na framework based on expectation (for example Craig et al.\n1997, 2001; Vernon et al. 2010; Williamson et al. 2012).\nFor an overview of prevision, see Goldstein(1986b), for a\ndetailed treatment of the development of probability from\nexpectation see Whittle (1992) and for a detailed treatment\nof the statistical rationale and the practical implications of\nthis approach to uncertainty speciﬁcation and analysis see\nGoldstein and Wooff (2007).\nWe adopt this approach throughout so that our uncer-\ntainty speciﬁcations in this paper take the form of speci-\nfying means, variances, and covariances for quantities of\ninterest without assuming underlying probability distribu-\ntions. We shall obey the convention and refer to this as the\nBayes linear approach. We make this choice to simplify\nboth the speciﬁcations required to derive the statistical\nmodels and the resulting computation required for our\nhistory matching procedures.",

However, many simulations take a lot\nlonger and some are never returned.\nOur ensemble design reﬂects the requirement for short\nsimulations, with a short spin-up phase and idealised\nforcing applied straight from the pre-industrial conditions.\nThe model is spun up for 50 years at each of the 10,000\nsettings of the model parameters, followed by a 70-year\ntransient CO2 simulation where CO2 concentrations are\nincreased by ð100 \u0005 DÞ% each year where D is treated as\nanother model parameter to be perturbed within the range\n[0, 0.04]. All members are initialised with preindustrial\nCO2 concentrations and with initial conditions from the\nstandard, unperturbed model. Parallel control simulations,\nwhere CO2 remains at preindustrial levels, are also con-\nducted to allow us to monitor continued drift from the spin\nup.\nThe parameters to be perturbed are listed in Table 4.\nThese are a subset of perturbations from previous studies\nwith perturbations to atmosphere, sea ice and land models\n(Murphy et al. 2004; Sanderson et al. 2010) and pertur-\nbations to ocean parameters (Collins et al. 2007; Sanderson\net al. 2010). Not all of the parameters identiﬁed in those\nstudies were perturbed. The nature of the CPDN project\nalso meant that switches between different parameterisa-\ntion choices and schemes could not be perturbed for this\nstudy. We were also given a list of parameter pairs by the\nMet Ofﬁce that were to be varied jointly following rela-\ntionships they speciﬁed. For each pair we only include one\nparameter in the list of independent parameters to be varied\nin our design and used the given relationships to calculate\nthe values of the others. See Appendix C for further details.\nWe chose the settings of the input parameters to satisfy\ntwo competing experimental design goals. Our ﬁrst goal\nwas to have a large ensemble of model runs within the area\nof parameter space used by previous studies. The second\nwas to explore parameter choices outside of this space that\nmay yield interesting (and as yet unseen in HadCM3)\nbehaviour, such as abrupt collapse of the AMOC under\nincreasing CO2. The boundaries of the space used in pre-\nvious studies can be seen in Tables 5 and 6 and will be\nreferred to as the ‘‘standard’’ space. We devoted 80 % of\nour ensemble to a design in this parameter space.\nWe devoted the remaining 20 % of our ensemble to the\nexpanded parameter space deﬁned in columns 5 and 6 of\nTable 5 in Appendix C. We restricted any parameters with\nknown dependencies on other parameters to be within the\nstandard ranges on the advice of our Met Ofﬁce collabo-\nrators. Of the remaining parameters, there was no formal\nrule used to choose the new limits, though generally each\nrange was extended uniformly by between 25 and 50 %,\nwhilst avoiding letting any parameter get too close to or\ncross 0.",

The size of our ensemble\nallows us to use a space ﬁlling design in the input parameters.\nWe choose the actual values of the inputs by uniform Latin\nHypercube sampling (Santner et al. 2003) within the speci-\nﬁed ranges of each subspace. This method divides the range\nof each parameter into equal intervals and ensures that\nexactly one point is sampled from each interval. Maximin\nLatin Hypercubes, Latin Hypercubes chosen to maximise the\nminimum distance between design points (Morris and\nMitchell 1995), are often used to select space ﬁlling designs\nbecause they offer a good coverage of parameter space.\nWhilst good coverage of parameter space is very important,\nwe must also ensure that our continuous parameters are not\nhighly correlated with one another or with any of the switch\nvariables. If they were this would make it difﬁcult to identify\nthe parameters that drive the variability during emulation.\nWe ensure that our design in each of the input param-\neters is as uncorrelated and well spread out as possible by\nsatisfying S-optimality within the class of Latin Hyper-\ncubes satisfying a constraint on the maximum correlation\n(0.1) between any two variables. S-optimality seeks to\nmaximise the harmonic mean of all pairwise inter-point\ndistances within the given class of latin hypercubes (Zag-\nlauer 2012). The resulting design covers the parameter\nspace well and ensures none of the variables are highly\ncorrelated. We check that there are no very small eigen-\nvalues of the covariance matrices of each sub-design and\nthe full design to make sure there is no degeneracy.\nFinally, we treat the mixed layer parameters slightly\ndifferently to the way they are treated in Collins et al.\n(2007). In that experiment, they are a switch with three\nsettings. Acreman and Jeffery (2007) treat these parameters\nas continuous within given ranges, and we follow this\ntreatment for all but 2000 of the ensemble members within\nthe standard ranges. Acreman and Jeffery (2007) ﬁnd that\nthere is signiﬁcant interaction between the parameters in\nthe Kraus and Turner (1967) bulk mixed layer model.\nHowever, to fully explore any interactions with other\nparameters in the fully coupled model, and to help build\nemulators, we vary them separately.\nAt the time of writing, we have 3,500 control simula-\ntions and 5,000 transient simulations completed. If we\ninclude all partial simulations from which we have data\nreturned, we have approximately 2 million years of Had-\nCM3 data thanks to the generosity of the members of the\ngeneral public around the world who have contributed their\nspare computing resources.",

Paleoclimate\nrecords suggest that the AMOC has previously undergone\nmajor rapid ﬂuctuations (McManus et al. 2004). The heat\ntransported northward by the AMOC, recently estimated to\nbe in the region of 1.33 ± 0.4 petawatts at 26.5\u0003N (Johns\net al. 2011), is gradually released to the atmosphere where\nit is carried towards Europe by the predominantly westerly\nwinds. This heat transport contributes to the comparatively\nmilder winters experienced in northwestern Europe than at\nsimilar latitudes in Western Canada (Rhines and Ha¨kkinen\n2003; Broecker 1987).\nExperiments with climate models under predicted future\nemissions scenarios have suggested that there could be\naround a 30 % reduction in the strength of the AMOC by\nthe year 2100 (Solomon et al. 2007; Gregory et al. 2005),\nwith a corresponding impact on the northward heat trans-\nport. However, the risk of a sudden collapse of the AMOC\nis not conﬁdently known, and improving our understanding\nof this risk and its uncertainties is a key objective.\nChanges in the AMOC are particularly important\nbecause of their effect on the Atlantic ocean Meridional\nHeat Transport (MHT), which in turn has an impact on the\nclimate of the North Atlantic. Although it might be\nexpected that a model with a weaker AMOC has less MHT,\nthere are other factors that play a role. The relative tem-\nperature of the water being advected by the AMOC may be\ndifferent, and the contribution of the gyre transport is also\nimportant. We will investigate the how the AMOC and\nMHT strengths and their sensitivities to increasing CO2 are\naffected by our history matching.\nIn Fig. 1 we plot the AMOC time series at 26\u0003N and\n1,000 m depth from the complete runs for both the transient\nand control runs separately. The transient simulations are\ncoloured by D. From this picture, we can see that we have a\nvery wide range of AMOC behaviours in our ensemble.\nSome runs with technical faults, as a result of issues in\nwriting or transferring model output, are removed from the\nensemble and treated as missing data. The two visible\ncommon peaks at around 18 years and around 50 years\nmay be the result of a mechanism of climate variability\nwhich has been artiﬁcially triggered by the parameter\nperturbations and is the subject of a forthcoming paper.\nIn order to set up any HadCM3 based inference about\nthe effect of CO2 forcing on the true AMOC and the cor-\nresponding heat transport, we would have to construct an\nemulator for the AMOC, and one of the longer term goals\nof our project is to emulate its evolution in time. If\nattempted within the full parameter space, this already\ndaunting task would be much harder. This is because our\nstatistical models would have to do most of their work\nattempting to capture the extreme non linear behaviours\nthat we suspect are non-physical and may be removed by",

We have chosen to use\nsimple, univariate, global and hemispheric averages as\nconstraints rather than more complex quantities such as\nspatial ﬁelds (as in Sexton et al. 2011), for two main rea-\nsons. Firstly, one of the principal goals of this history\nmatch is to use quantities that are physically important and\neasy to emulate across parameter space as an initial way of\nruling out implausible regions. Secondly, the lack of\ntwentieth century forcing in our ensemble leaves us limited\nin terms of the relevant observational data available. We do\nnot have preindustrial observations over sufﬁciently large\nspatial ﬁelds to warrant their use in a history match. There\nare likely to be many parameter combinations that produce\n‘unphysical’ climate states, deemed not implausible by this\nprocess. These may be ruled out by future history matching\nor Bayesian calibration, perhaps using further constraints.\nIn an analysis that goes on to provide probabilistic cli-\nmate predictions such as that in Murphy et al.

Note that\nour calibration may be even more powerful if this second\nhistory match is performed beforehand.\nThe ﬁrst constraint we use is global mean surface air\ntemperature (SAT). This can vary substantially from\nobservations (with values across the ensemble ranging\nbetween -5 and 33 \u0003C) as the parameter perturbations alter\nthe radiative balance at the top of the atmosphere. SAT has\nalso been shown to have a large correlation with the\nAMOC strength in a previous perturbed physics ensemble\nbased on HadCM3 (Jackson et al. 2012). Observational\nconstraints were calculated using the present day HadC-\nRUT3 climatology (Brohan et al. 2006) to give 14 \u0003C,\nwhich is also consistent with the value of 14.0 ± 0.5 \u0003C\nfrom Jones et al. (1999).\nA preindustrial value is estimated by using HadCRUT3\nanomalies to calculate a change since preindustrial times.\nSince this observation set only started in 1850 and obser-\nvations were scarce during the early part of the period,\nvalues during 1850-1880 were used to represent the pre-\nindustrial period with the assumption that temperatures had\nchanged little since preindustrial times.\nFor each 30 year period (1850–1880 and 1960–1990 for\npresent day) a time average of SAT was calculated at each\ndata grid point for each month. In this way a seasonal\nclimatology was created for, say January, using all data\nfrom any grid point containing data from at least one\nJanuary in that 30 year period.

Combining these studies\nand accounting for the rounding we have done to arrive at\nthese numbers we obtain the constraint of 13.6 ± 0.5 \u0003C.\nThe second constraint used is the northern hemisphere\nmeridional SAT gradient (SGRAD, measured as the dif-\nference between averages over 0-20\u0003N and 50-70\u0003N to\navoid errors associated with sparse observations in the\nArctic). The gradient is related to the net (ocean and\natmosphere) meridional heat transport, used for ruling out\nregions of parameter space where an unreasonably low or\nhigh transport of heat from lower to higher latitudes is\npredicted. The third constraint is the average northern\nhemisphere seasonal cycle of SAT (SCYC, June–August\naverage minus December–February average). The strength\nof the seasonal cycle is related to the sensitivity of the\nclimate to changing external forcing, in this case to the\nseasonally varying solar radiation, suggesting that this\nmight be an important observational constraint.\nThese two constraints are calculated from the present\nday HadCRUT3 climatologies, with observational errors\ncalculated as the difference between this value and that\ncalculated from an alternative climatology from Legates\nand Willmott (1990). For SGRAD a difference from pre-\nindustrial conditions is assessed by a comparison of the\n1960–1990 and 1850–1880 climatologies described above.\nThe meridional SAT gradient only differs by 0.03 \u0003C\nbetween the two climatologies, and a comparison of spatial\ndifferences suggests little sensitivity to latitude, apart from\nhigh latitudes north of 70\u0003N which were excluded from\nSGRAD because of the sparsity of data. This change is\njudged to be negligible.\nUsing the seasonal climatologies from the two time\nperiods to construct a change since preindustrial times for\nSCYC gives a value of 0.17 \u0003C. This is less than, though of\nthe same order as, the deﬁned observational error. Addi-\ntionally, the temperature difference is spatially inhomoge-\nneous and concentrated over Europe where a timeseries can\nbe created because of good spatial and temporal observa-\ntional coverage. This timeseries suggests that this differ-\nence is part of the multi-decadal variability, rather than a\nsystematic trend. Hence the difference in SCYC since\npreindustrial times is taken to be zero.\nThe ﬁnal constraint is that of global mean precipitation\n(PRECIP, kg/m2/s). Although this is expected to vary with\nglobal mean SAT, it provides an important constraint on\nthe hydrological cycle.

However, based on recent measurements of surface\ndownward longwave radiation, it has been suggested that\nthese values may be underestimates (Stephens et al. 2012),\nwith the implied global mean precipitation rate being\n3.1 ± 0.6 mm/day. This present-day range is used to obtain\nan estimate for the corresponding pre-industrial value by\nusing an estimated percentage change in global mean\nprecipitation per degree of global warming (2.2 ± 0.52 %\nK-1 Frieler et al. 2011). This reduces the present-day\nprecipitation rate by 0.74 % (a very small reduction when\ncompared with the observational uncertainty).\nThe constraints, z, above, have each been given obser-\nvational error in the form of a range. We require a variance\nfor the observation error, e, and so we interpret these\nranges as 2 standard deviations. This interpretation is\nbroadly consistent with treating each range as a 95 %\nconﬁdence interval for the constraint. Though it may be\nmore natural to view the given ranges as bounds on the\nobservational error, the variances we would derive from\nthis view would be far smaller than under our interpreta-\ntion. Treating these as 2 standard deviations represents a\ncautious approach that will mean Var[e] is larger than it\nmight have been under an interpretation of the given ranges\nas bounds and will therefore result in less parameter space\nremoved by history matching.\nThe values of z and Var[e], are presented in Table 1.\nNote that if our interpretation of the ranges were actually\ncorrect, the given variances may be underestimates due to\nthe fact that we do not have real pre-industrial observa-\ntions, only estimates for them. We discuss this further in\nthe context of our implausibility measure and explore the\nsensitivity to variance underestimation in Sects. 4 and 5.",

The richest source\nof information about discrepancy therefore comes directly\nfrom the modellers themselves, who are aware of their\nmodel’s deﬁciencies and the ways in which they might be\nimproved in order to make them ‘closer’ to the true\nclimate.\nPrevious climate studies, such as that undertaken to\nprovide the UK Climate Projections (Murphy et al. 2009),\nhave avoided an elicitation of model discrepancy variance\nfrom model developers. Instead, model discrepancy vari-\nance has been speciﬁed using a multi-model ensemble\n(MME) from the World Climate Research Programme’s\nCoupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3)\nmulti-model dataset (Meehl et al. 2007). Sexton et al.\n(2011) derive a discrepancy variance from a subset of the\nCMIP3 models they judged to be ‘‘state-of-the-art’’ using\nrelationship (2) and their HadSM3 emulators for the dif-\nferent observations. The emulators are used to ﬁnd the\nclosest match of HadSM3 to each CMIP3 model and a\ndiscrepancy variance is calculated by computing the vari-\nance of all differences between the CMIP3 model output\nand the emulator prediction.\nThere are a number of uncertainties ignored under this\napproach, the principal of which being that each of the\nCMIP3 members itself has its own model discrepancy so\nthat the difference between each state-of-the-art model and\nits closest analogue in the model used to generate the PPE\nmight be a tiny fraction of the difference between true\nclimate and the model at its best input.\nWithout an elicitation involving the modellers of Had-\nCM3, we view model discrepancy variance as our ‘toler-\nance to error’. This means that in specifying uncertainty for\nmodel discrepancy, we are implicitly commenting on how\nfar we are happy for HadCM3, run at its best input, to be\nfrom the true climate. Note that this interpretation of model\ndiscrepancy has implications for the results of a history\nmatch, particularly if all of the parameter space is deemed\nnot implausible. With an expert-judgement based model\ndiscrepancy variance, ruling out all of parameter space\nwould be seen as a sign that the discrepancy variance had\nbeen mis-speciﬁed as the degree to which the climate\nmodel output differs from the true climate had been under\nestimated. However, under a tolerance to error interpreta-\ntion, ruling out all of space is a sign that, given the level of\nclimate model deﬁciency we are prepared to accept for the\npurposes of any analysis, the model under study is unin-\nformative for the aspects of climate in question. Under this\ninterpretation of the model discrepancy variance it is nat-\nural to explore the effect of different tolerances to error on\nour inferences.\nHowever, we do prefer to have a physical basis for\nselecting those tolerances that we do. We therefore follow\nprevious studies and base our speciﬁcation on the CMIP3",

This choice\nleads to tractability of the denominator of the implausibility\nfunction in (7) and the estimate for its components in Sect.\n4.2. Though for a = 1 an alternative estimator for the key\ncomponents of the implausibility calculation would need to\nbe found, an alternative form of (7) is available with a\nfactor of a2 in front of the last 2 terms. This implies that for\na \\ 1, where the MME ensemble mean is believed to over\nestimate climate y, implausibility is larger than for a = 1\nfor all x0 (if Var[U] is unchanged) so that more space is\nruled out if all of the terms are known. The converse is also\ntrue with a [ 1 leading to less parameter space being ruled\nout. A choice of a = 1 represents a strong view that prior\nto observing the MME, we believe it has a systematic bias.\nLet our climate model of interest, (in our case HadCM3)\nbe f h, with h 2 f1; . . .; mg so that f h is also an MME\nmember.

As acknowledged by Rougier et al. (2012),\nbecause the names of each CMIP3 member tell a climate\nscientist a great deal about the model output, the models\nare not second order exchangeable unless we choose to\nadopt ignorance about the different CMIP3 models.\nHowever, we have already stated the difﬁculty in\nobtaining discrepancy judgements from model developers\nfor one model (HadCM3) and the unavailability of these\njudgements in this case has led us to explore using an\nMME. Without second order exchangeability we would\nrequire similar and separate judgements for each CMIP3\nmember in order to use the MME at all. Rougier et al.\n(2012) choose to compromise and only use a subset of\nCMIP3 that they judge to be ‘‘broadly’’ second order\nexchangeable, by which they mean that the models in the\nchosen subset are sufﬁciently similar by reputation in their\njudgement to adopt second order exchangeability over the\nsubset prior to observing the CMIP3 data. We take the\nsame approach and choose a subset of CMIP3 containing\nHadCM3 that we judge to be broadly exchangeable. We\nare comfortable doing this due to our interpretation of the\nmodel discrepancy variance as our tolerance to error and\nbecause we intend to conduct a sensitivity analysis for\ndifferent tolerances.\nIn order for the chosen subset to be ‘broadly’ second\norder exchangeable with HadCM3, we should choose\nmodels that we have no a priori reason to think would be\nany closer to reality, in terms of their resolution and\nphysical description of climate, than HadCM3, and that are\nnot highly correlated with each other. We therefore use at\nmost one model from each research centre, selected to be\nmost like HadCM3 in terms of the parametrization schemes\nand the resolution.\nThe CMIP3 members we used were the models {GFDL-\nCM2.0, INM-CM3.0, BCCR-BCM2.0, IPSL-CM4, PCM,",

Other models were ruled out as not\nbeing second order exchangeable with HadCM3 or because\nanother model from the same group was judged to be more\nsimilar to HadCM3 based on its resolution and parameter\nschemes.\nTable 2 shows the estimates for Var[U] and Var[Rj]\nobtained from the subset of CMIP3 models used. Origi-\nnally the estimate of Var[U] for SGRAD was -0.171. This\nmay have been because second order exchangeability\nbreaks down for SGRAD or for one of the reasons\ndescribed in Sect. 4.2. In this case, we had a large value of\nS and Var[e] compared with the other variables. This\nsuggested that the sampling distribution of the assessment\nwe have used may have had a large variance. This could\nalso have suggested that SGRAD may not be a good\nquantity to match to as we have a lot of uncertainty\nregarding the observations, and the climate modelling\ncommunity (represented by the MME members) has little\nagreement in their representations of it. The value in the\ntable was obtained by the method described below.\nTo explore the sampling distribution of Var[U] for any\nconstraint, we assume that f 1; . . .; f m follow a normal dis-\ntribution and sample m new values, f 1; . . .; f m from\nNðM; SÞ, an e from N(0, Var[e]), and a value U from N(0,\nrU\n2 ), for some rU\n2 . We then calculate a sample value\nz ¼ M þ U þ e and compute a sample Var[U] that\ndepends on rU. Taking a large sample of such values for a\nwide range of rU gives insight into the distribution of our\ndata-based estimates. In particular, how likely we are to\nobserve negative values for positive rU.\nNote that there is no ‘‘objective’’ reason to sample\nf 1; . . .; f m; e and U from normal distributions in the way we\nhave suggested. Any method of generating alternative\nsamples from a distribution of interest will lead to a sen-\nsitivity study than could be undertaken.

It turns out that the\nsampling distribution of Var[U] is heavily skewed (we\nexplain why this is below), which leads to the possibility of\nnegative estimates when the variance is large. In order to\nchoose a value of Var[U] that is consistent with having\nobserved a negative estimate, we select a value of 0.483, so\nthat there is a 50 % chance of observing a negative value\nand a 39 % chance of observing a value less than or equal\nto the negative one above.\nWe use the described sampling method to choose ‘low’\nand ‘high’ values of Var[U] consistent with the data for\neach constraint in order to conduct a sensitivity analysis.\nOur initial idea was to use ‘high’ and ‘low’ values of\nVar[U] by selecting the lowest/highest Var[U] such that the\nsampled or ‘standard’ value was in the upper/lower tercile\nof the sampling distribution. However, the sampling dis-\ntributions appeared quite skewed so that there was little\ndifference between the standard values and the lower ter-\nciles.

The different values of Var[U] for each experi-\nment are given in Table 2.\nThe skewed sampling distributions for Var[U] are due to\nour sampling method which leads to z samples (z being our\nobservational constraints) being normal.

For each set of\nparameter values in the ensemble, X[n], we calculate the\nimplausibility of each output and plot them pairwise. The\ncolours on the ﬁgure indicate density of points, with light\nblue indicating a low density of points and magenta indi-\ncating a high density. The red dashed lines indicate the\nimplausibility cut off with points above or to the right of\nthose lines ruled out. We see immediately that SAT is the\ndominant observational constraint.\nThe patterns in Fig. 2 show correlations between the\nimplausibilities. This indicates that the constraints them-\nselves may be correlated. As stated in Sect. 3.3, we\nexpected some correlation between PRECIP and SAT\n(Frieler et al. 2011). However, the observed correlation is\nhigher than expected at 0.96. In addition, both SGRAD and\nSCYC are negatively correlated with SAT, the former\nhaving a correlation of -0.68 with SAT and the latter a\nstrong correlation of -0.89 with SAT. The correlations are\nabout the same in NROY space, indicating that these\nrelationships are not an artefact of ‘unphysical’ climates in\nour ensemble.\nPrevious GCM studies have found that increased tem-\nperatures due to increased greenhouse gases result in a\ngreater warming at higher latitudes (‘polar ampliﬁcation’)\nand a greater warming in winter (Manabe and Stouffer\n1980; Solomon et al. 2007). It has been suggested that this\nis a result of a sea-ice albedo feedback where less ice\nresults in a greater absorption of shortwave radiation and\nhence more warming in the high latitudes, particularly in\nwinter. This would result in a decreased meridional tem-\nperature gradient, and a decreased seasonal cycle. In our",

Though SGRAD is\nweakly negatively correlated with SAT when compared to\nSCYC, its observational error variance and discrepancy are\nmuch larger in comparison to those for SAT. This means\nthat SGRAD provides only a slight further constraint after\naccounting for SAT.\nIt is important to note that although SAT dominates and\nthat, for SCYC and PRECIP at least, no ensemble members\nthat are not ruled out by SAT alone are ruled out by the\nadditional constraints, that does not mean that the addi-\ntional variables provide no further constraint on parameter\nspace. It simply means that all of our ruled out ensemble\nmembers have implausible SAT (or SGRAD in the case of\none ensemble member). Ruled out space is a vast subspace\nof our original 27 dimensional parameter space for which\nwe have a very sparse sample in our ensemble. There may\nbe a subspace of this ruled out space where SAT is not\nimplausible but one or more of the other constraints is\nimplausible. If this subspace is relatively small, it would be\nhighly unlikely to see any of our ensemble members in\nthere and, indeed, either ﬁnding points in small subspaces\nor proving that no such subspace exists is a challenging and\nopen research question.\nThe power of history matching, versus ensemble ﬁlter-\ning as described in 1, is that we can take any point in\nparameter space and determine whether or not it is in\nNROY space. We can do this because those ensemble\nmembers that are ruled out by history matching have been\nused to train our emulators and inform us about the regions\nwe want to rule out.",

Since it\nis SAT that is the strongest constraint on our ensemble (see\nFig. 2), it may be that these parameters have a large impact\non the implausibility through changing SAT by modifying\nthe radiative properties of the atmosphere.\nThe ﬁnal parameter shown is ahi1_si, the isopycnal\ndiffusivity in the ocean which transfers properties such as\ntemperature and salinity along contours of constant density.\nWhere sloping isopycnals exist (e.g at high latitudes)\nahi1_si drives an upward heat ﬂux (against the global mean\nvertical temperature gradient) because the salinity derived\ndensity changes dominate (Brierley et al. 2010). Brierley\net al. (2010) found that although ahi1_si does have an\nimpact on SAT, perturbations of the vertical diffusivity had\nslightly bigger impacts on temperature. In this study ver-\ntical diffusivity is also perturbed, but it is found to have\nmuch less impact. The importance of ahi1_si here may be\ndue to complex interactions between different parameters,\nthat can only be captured using large ensembles. We also\nnote that the timescales over which parameter perturbations\ntake effect may differ by several orders of magnitude.\nChanges to atmospheric parameters will typically require a\nfew weeks to months of model integration to reach equi-\nlibrium, whilst changes to ocean parameters may require\ndecades or even centuries before quasi equilibrium is\nreached. Therefore our relatively short model integrations\nmay mean we are not capturing the full behaviour of all of\nthe ocean parameters.\nWe compare our NROY space with the results reported\nin the Bayesian calibration of HadSM3 in Sexton et al.\n(2011). HadSM3 has the same atmospheric, land and sea\nice components as HadCM3, but uses a mixed layer slab\nocean model rather than a dynamic ocean model. Most of\ntheir perturbed parameters coincide with those atmosphere\nparameters perturbed in this study, although they cannot\nperturb any ocean parameters. In their analysis they ﬁnd\nthat entcoef imposes the largest constraint and that values\nat the high end of the prescribed range are extremely\nunlikely to be x\u0005.\nThe amount of posterior density given to high values of\nrhcrit and ct in their study after using their ﬁrst two con-\nstraints corresponds to the higher density of points in\nNROY space we see with higher values of ct and rhcrit.\nHowever, when further constraints are imposed in their\nstudy, their distributions become weighted more towards\nthe standard settings. They state that their ﬁrst constraint is\nhighly associated with top of the atmosphere radiative\nbalance. Since models with a slab ocean, such as HadSM3,\nconstrain SAT at the expense of altering the top of the\natmosphere radiative balance, this is equivalent to a",

However, AOGCMs of different\nresolution can be linked statistically (Williamson et al.\n2012) so that large PPEs using coarser-resolution models and\na small PPE using a very expensive model can be used\ntogether to emulate the advanced model and quantify its\nparametric uncertainty in the ways we have described.\nThe speciﬁcation of a statistical model relating a climate\nmodel to the real climate system is important in any model-\nbased quantiﬁcation of uncertainty or risk assessment in the\nreal world. The most popular statistical model for this\ndeﬁnes the real climate to be the sum of the model eval-\nuated at the ‘best input’ x\u0005, and an uncorrelated model\ndiscrepancy term via Eq.

We\nhave introduced an alternative statistical model (Sect. 4.1)\nfor the case when detailed expert judgements are not\navailable.

Though our sta-\ntistical model allows tractable discrepancy variance esti-\nmates to be readily obtained, it represents just one possible\nway of obtaining these judgements. Further innovations in\nstatistics may lead to improvements in this model or\nimproved alternative models.\nAn ideal analysis, and perhaps the only way to truly\nquantify this uncertainty, must involve expert judgement\nregarding the deﬁciencies in the mathematical representa-\ntions of the physics in the model and the ways they might\nbe improved in order to capture these deﬁciencies in future\ngenerations of models (see Goldstein and Rougier 2009, for\nfurther discussion).",

Switch\nparameters were treated as factors (variables with a small\nnumber of distinct possible ‘‘levels’’) and factor interac-\ntions with all continuous parameters were allowed.\nFirst we perform a forward selection procedure where\nwe permit each variable to be added to g(x) in its lowest\navailable form. So if ct is not yet in g(x), ct can be added,\nbut ct2 cannot be added. If ct is already in g(x) then ct2 can\nbe added, but we simultaneously add all ﬁrst order inter-\nactions with the other variables in g(x) so that the resulting\nstatistical model will be robust to changes of scale (see\nDraper and Smith 1998, for discussion). We do similar for\nthird order interactions. The term(s) added at each stage is\nthe one that reduces the residual sum of squares from the\nregression the most.\nWhen it becomes clear that adding more terms is not\nimproving the predictive power of the emulator (a judge-\nment made by the statistician based on looking at the\nproportion of variability explained by the regression and at\nplots of the residuals from the ﬁt) we begin a backwards\nelimination algorithm. This removes terms, one at a time,\nwith the least contribution to the sum of squares explained,\nwithout compromising the model. Lower order terms are\nnot permitted to be removed from g(x) whilst higher order\nterms remain. We stop when the removing the next term\nchosen by the algorithm leads to a poorer statistical model.\nFor more details on forwards selection methods and\nbackwards elimination, see Draper and Smith (1998).\nThe emulators contained between 76 terms in g(x) (in\nthe case of SAT) and 44 terms (in the case of PRECIP). For\nthe SAT emulator, it was found that the response was easier\nto model as a function of log(entcoef), though this",
