The CDE values extracted from 3-D seismic data can be tied\nto any ground-truthed property of strata regardless of their\ndepositional history, age, and lithology. The application of the\nCDE method is, however, dependent on seismic-data acqui-\nsition parameters and selected processing sequences and should\nbe independently applied to different seismic volumes. Bore-\nhole data indicate contrast (C) to reflect MTDs lithological\nheterogeneity and degree of disaggregation, which increase\nproportionally to the absolute value of C. More uniform values\nof P-wave velocity (Vp) and peak shear strength are recorded in\nstrata with lower contrast. Directionality (D) relates to the\nexistence of syn- or postdepositional fabric such as compres-\nsional ridges, imbricated strata or faults. Energy (E) relates to\nthe acoustic impedance of strata, with high-amplitude reflec-\ntions correlating with strata with higher shear strength, i.e.,\nhigh Vp and shear-wave velocity (Vs) values, or with abrupt",

In contrast, submarine landslides can\nreach hundreds of kilometers in single or recurrent instability\nevents, which commonly result in the accumulation of large vol-\numes of strata, or mass-transport deposits (MTDs) (Hühnerbach\net al., 2004; Moscardelli and Wood, 2008). Similar instability\nphenomena are observed on other planets, where it is believed\nthat earthquakes, or hydrologic cycles, are of enough magni-\ntude to trigger large-scale slope instability on weakened surface\nrocks (McEwen, 1989; Schulz, 2002; Lucas and Mangeney,\n2007; Moscardelli and Wood, 2011; Moscardelli et al., 2012).\nWireline and sediment core data from continental margins\naround the world have shown that distinct degrees of stratal\ndisaggregation in MTDs are reflected as variations in their struc-\ntural and petrophysical properties (Dott, 1963; Nardin et al.,\n1979). These variations commonly result in the migration and\nescape of fluids to the surface (Paull et al., 1996, 2003; Bünz\net al., 2005; Flemings et al., 2005; Masson et al., 2006), partic-\nularly in regions with low net-to-gross ratios or showing signifi-\ncant internal deformation in the form of folds, faults, and frac-\ntures (Flemings et al, 2005; Bull et al., 2008). In addition, MTDs\nabove certain porosity thresholds comprise important hydro-\ncarbon reservoirs, as in the case of the Oligocene Frio Forma-\ntion of south Texas (Ogiesoba and Hammes 2012), the Mio-\ncene Harang embankment in Louisiana (Edwards, 2000), or\nthe prolific Ubit, Asabo, and Enang fields from offshore Nigeria\n(Clayton et al., 1998; Apotria et al., 2004; Bruso et al., 2004).\nMost of these oil and gas fields comprise either large-scale\nblocks or coarse-grained material that was slumped, translated,",

In such complex stratigraphic successions,\nto recognize and describe MTDs was shown to be\ncrucial to optimal well planning and hydrocarbon\nproduction (Ogiesoba and Hammes, 2012).\nNotwithstanding their economic importance,\na key difficulty when interpreting buried MTDs\nconcerns their recognition as either reservoir in-\ntervals or competent seal units. Caveats are par-\nticularly recorded when interpreting older MTDs,\nknowing of their tendency to lose diagnostic fea-\ntures with increasing compaction. In fact, original\ndepositional features, compartmentalization styles,\ndips of remnant strata, and degree of strata disrup-\ntion (or tortuosity, sensu Salem and Chilingarian,\n2000; Matthews et al., 2008; Tiab and Donaldson,\n2011) approach those of confining bedded strata at\ndepths of 7000–10,000 ft (2133–3048 m) (Ogiesoba\nand Hammes, 2012). Advanced methods to recog-\nnize MTDs, and their internal character, are there-\nfore necessary to assist their interpretation in deeply\nburied successions. In particular, any new methods\nmust be useful (1) to assess seal competence in\nstratigraphic sequences recording multiple insta-\nbility events, (2) to understand the reservoir po-\ntential of individual MTDs, and (3) to examine the\ndegree of recurrence and regional scales of individ-\nual mass-transport events (Day et al., 1999; Driscoll\net al., 2000; Masson et al., 2002; Haflidason et al.,\n2004; Pérez-Torrado et al., 2006; Urgeles et al., 2007;\nLee, 2009; Yamada et al., 2012). New methods\nshould also be applicable to different geophysical\ndata sets, ranging from industry three-dimensional\n(3-D) seismic volumes to high-resolution reflec-\ntion profiles. They should also be applicable to data\nsets such as side-scan sonar mosaics, bathymetric\nmaps, chirp profiles, or light detection and ranging\n(LIDAR), in both the two-dimensional (R2) and\nthree-dimensional space (R3) (Metternicht et al.,\n2005).\nIn this article, we use high-quality 3-D seismic\nvolumes from southeast Japan and southeast Bra-\nzil, together with borehole data from the Nankai\nTrough and 11 other drilling sites from the Ocean",

This is an important character, as strata\nwithin specific zones of MTDs can show similar\ndeformation styles, basal erosional features, and\nboundary features regardless of their size or litho-\nlogical nature (Varnes, 1978; Frey-Martinez et al.,\n2006; Bull et al., 2008). However, the provenance\n(i.e., source strata) and magnitude of downslope\ntransport of MTDs are key factors controlling\ntheir internal architecture (e.g., Jenner et al., 2007;\nOmosanya and Alves, 2013), commonly adding\ncomplexity to any MTD classification based on 3-D\ngeomorphological features alone. Provenance and\ntransporting distances are also important controls\non MTD potential as seals or reservoirs because\nporosity and permeability are significantly reduced\nafter downslope gravitational movements be-\ncause of the high degree of deformation they show\n(Moscardelli et al., 2006).

Sediment progradation\nonto the continental slope also resulted in signifi-\ncant halokinesis, further destabilizing the south-\neast Brazilian margin and feeding large salt fair-\nways, canopies, and diapirs toward the distal slope\n(e.g., Fiduk et al., 2004). These phenomena oc-\ncurred together with thin-skinned extension up-\nslope because of the gravitational gliding of post-\nsalt strata (Demercian et al., 1993), in large-scale\nmovements that were also facilitated by volcanic\nactivity at the Abrolhos Bank between 60 and\n40 Ma (Mohriak, 2005).\nThe seismic stratigraphy of the Espírito Santo\nBasin is shown in Figure 5B. The MTDs analyzed\nin this article are part of the N20–N60 sequences,\nwhich comprise an alternating succession of chaotic\nto continuous reflections, at places interrupted by\nincising submarine channels (Figures 3B, C; 4A, B).\nMoreira and Carminatti (2004) interpreted the\nN20–N60 sequences as representing successive re-\ngressive and transgressive events on the Brazilian\nmargin. The age of N20–N60 ranges from the early\nMiocene to Holocene, meaning that it is age equiva-\nlent to the Rio Doce (siliciclastic), Caravelas (carbon-\nate), and Urucutuca (shaley) Members (Figure 5B).\nIn the BES-100 volume, the N20–N60 sequences\ncomprise an alternation of the three latter units\n(França et al., 2007) (Figures 3B, 4B). In the BE-\nMS-1 volume, the interpreted MTDs are part of a\nmoderate- to low-amplitude sequence, at places de-\nformed by closely spaced normal faults (Figures 3C,\n4C).

The extraction of CDE values is only\nmeaningful if the vertical resolution of the seismic\nsignal is enough to resolve any offsets and geolog-\nical features within MTDs, i.e., observed changes\nin stratal or fault dips depend on the bin size of the\nseismic volume as well as its vertical and lateral\nresolution (Yilmaz, 1987). In this case, coarse data\ndecimations and vertical samplings will obliterate\npart of the amplitude signal of seismic data, re-\nducing the accuracy of the interpretation.\nAnother limitation arises from the fact that\nabsolute values of amplitude recorded by a seis-\nmic volume depend primarily on the energy and\ntype of signal source(s) used during acquisition, as\nwell as on any bypass frequency filtering and am-\nplitude boost selected during processing (Damuth,\n1980; Damuth et al., 1988; Evans, 1997).

In addition to\ndata trimming, the amplitude spectrum of seismic\ndata, maximum penetration depths, and vertical\nand horizontal resolutions depend on the seismic\nsource used, i.e., if the acquisition system is of\nmoderate, high, or low resolution (see Faugères\net al., 1999, for an impact of different seismic\nmethods in the visualization of deep-marine strata).\nIn practice, this signifies that too low a signal fre-\nquency or spatial Nyquist number (a function of\nthe CMP trace spacing and acquisition geome-\ntry) will have an impact on what features are\nresolved on distinct 3-D volumes. Low vertical\nand horizontal resolutions can cause thin MTDs\nto be shown as fairly continuous strata or be\ncompletely unresolved (Widess, 1973; Morlet\net al., 1982).\nDespite these limitations, directionality (D)\nshould remain relatively constant in distinct 3-D\nvolumes if linear features are resolved, as it com-\nprises a seismic textural feature independent from\nselected acquisition parameters. For the purpose of\nrecognizing MTDs from confining hemipelagites,\ndepth-converted data should be primarily used to\ncalculate D, but the interpreter can also use two-\nway time volumes to calculate a relative (two-\nway time) D value, also considering that dips are\nprogressively hard to resolve with depth. Time-\ndepth conversions can also be applied locally to\nPSTM volumes to better estimate the absolute val-\nues of D.\nAbsolute amplitude values used in the calcu-\nlation of E and C can, however, vary significantly\ndepending on signal strength, frequency, and acous-\ntic source(s) used. To limit any discrepancies, am-\nplitude values of MTDs should be considered in\nthe CDE method relative to the background\namplitude of confining strata. In this article, we\nhomogenized C and E values using an algorithm\nthat considers the full spectrum of amplitudes\nwithin hemipelagites and continuous strata con-\nfining the MTDs to which the CDE method is\napplied. This same algorithm converts absolute\nvalues of C, D, and E in a constant sum, a necessary\ncondition to represent CDE values in ternary plots\n(Figure 8).",

These kinematic\nindicators can include features as varied as scours\n(Posamentier and Kolla, 2003; Weimer and Shipp,\n2004), basal grooves and striations (Gee et al.,\n2006), cat claws (Moscardelli et al., 2006), monkey\nfingers (McGilvery and Cook, 2003), frontal and\nlateral ramps and flats (Lucente and Pini, 2003),\nand faults and compressional ridges (Frey-Martinez\net al., 2006).\nTo apply the CDE method, the top and basal\nsurfaces of MTDs should be mapped in detail. These\ntop and basal surfaces will limit the seismic vol-\nume in which CDE values will be extracted. The\nsecond interpretation step consists in the com-\npilation of attribute maps (or 3-D volumes) from\navailable geophysical data (Figure 9). When using\n3-D seismic data, we favor the compilation of plan-\nview attribute data in the form of RMS ampli-\ntude and maximum magnitude (e.g., reflection\nstrength, cf., Brown, 2011) maps in successive in-\ntervals crossing the MTDs to account for their 3-D\nvariability (see Zeng et al., 1998a, b). Root-mean-\nsquare amplitude or maximum-magnitude maps\nprovide phase-independent records of amplitude\nvariations and highlight high-amplitude strata, in-\ndependently of their polarity, from low-amplitude\nfeatures (Brown, 2011). Reflective features such as\nremnant strata, or variations in the physical prop-\nerties of MTDs that lead to contrasts in acoustic\nimpedance, are shown as subgeometric features of\nrelatively high reflection strength (i.e., Energy), if\nspatially resolved on seismic data.

The uppermost MTD A does not show\nremnant and rafted blocks but, instead, is crosscut\nby a pervasive fabric, comprising extensional faults\nand compressional ridges generated during the ris-\ning of salt diapir B (Figures 13B, 14B). Faults are\nshown as low-amplitude lineaments on RMS am-\nplitude maps, with high-amplitude strata separat-\ning individual faults, i.e., reflecting an important\ncontrast between faulted and nonfaulted strata\n(Figures 13B, 14B). High-amplitude strata are\nlikely to comprise interbedded sands and shales\n(Fiduk et al., 2004) (Figures 5B). The closely spaced\nfaults, and moderately deformed strata separating\nthem, denote limited movement of this MTD,\nwhich was confined to the south and west by ris-\ning salt diapirs (Figures 2C, 13B, 14B). The low-\nermost MTD B comprises chaotic strata deformed\nand tilted on the flanks of the rising salt diapir B\n(Figures 13B, 14B).\nWe once again extracted data from seismic\nvolumes 100 × 100 lines and 100 ms crossing the\nfaulted, central region of the MTDs (Figure 16A,\nB). Amplitude and dip values were extracted from\nthe volume, and CDE values were plotted in the\nternary diagrams in Figure 16C and D. Strata in the\nfaulted MTD A plots toward the left of the ternary\ndiagram (as with MTDs 5 and 6 in Nankai and\narea 1 in southeast Brazil), i.e., being predomi-\nnantly of the C3 to C2 types. Importantly, the\nrange in D is relatively wide in the faulted MTD\nA for relatively low E values, despite the sharp\ncontrast in amplitude observed on RMS amplitude\nmaps (Figure 16B). This latter character results in\nhigh-C strata in MTD A (Figure 16A).\nSteeply dipping strata in MTD B are of mod-\nerate to low amplitude and have been deformed by\nhalokinesis and growth of the diapir (Figures 13B,\n14B, 16A). As expected, CDE values for MTD B\nplot well into the D2 section of the ternary plot,\nwith low E and moderate C (Figure 16D). This\ncorrelates with the likely presence of low net-to-",

In this CDE plot, we discriminate be-\ntween strata with distinct degrees of disaggregation\nalternating and intact blocks with remnant sub-\nhorizontal strata. Based on the plot in Figure 17 and\non data from the two other case studies, wide-\nspread CDE distributions in ternary plots are sug-\ngested to be the key diagnostic character that\ndistinguishes in-situ, nondeformed MTDs from\nconfining non-MTD strata (Figure 17). In particular,\nsubhorizontal layered strata will be shown with\nvariable CD values, but very low D (Figure 17). This\nobservation is significant and has implications to\nthe distinction of different zones in MTDs, known\nto comprise distinct internal fabrics and strata\nthicknesses (Frey-Martinez et al., 2006). The CDE\nmethod can therefore be used to recognize regions\nof MTDs, at the same time allowing the quantifi-\ncation of the seismic texture in such regions. This\npostulate will be the basis of the following discus-\nsion on the value of CDE values to distinguish\ndifferent zones in MTDs.",

Frontally emergent MTDs will\nshow unrestricted downslope translation of failed\nstrata until the slope angle will balance sediment\ninertia and lead to the complete stop of the MTD\n(Alves, 2013). Therefore, in toe regions of MTDs,\nfailed sediment will potentially show low C, D,\nand E when reflecting a high degree of disaggre-\ngation and very moderate amplitude contrasts in\nstrata. One significant control on C and E is the\nnature of the source of material remobilized during\nsea-floor failure; fine-grained material with large\nplasticity will tend to present lower values of C and\nE than coarser grained MTDs (Figure 17).\nThe relative value of D will depend on how\npervasive the structural fabric of an MTD is in re-\nlation to C and E. Illustrating this fact, rafted strata\nin the blocky MTD in BES-100 (southeast Brazil)\nshowing steep angles with the basal glide plane plot\nas moderate to high D on the CDE ternary diagram\n(Figure 17).

        "text": "An important conclusion from this article is\nthat specific CDE distributions separate MTDs\nfrom stratified intervals. When plotted on ternary\ndiagrams, CDE distributions can also be used to\nidentify distinct sediment sources from which MTDs\ncan derive. In particular, MTDs comprising coarse-\ngrained strata should differ from homogeneous\nmudstones and shales in terms of their continuity,\ninternal architecture, and amplitude.\nThis work also shows that specific regions in\nMTDs present specific C, D, and E values that can\nbe plotted against borehole petrophysical proper-\nties via ternary plots. The most common MTDs in\nnature (chaotic to transparent) will plot as mod-\nerate- to high-C and -D strata with relatively low\nvalues of E. Strata with a marked vertical direc-\ntionality (dilational faults or steeply dipping strata)\npresent high values of D. In essence, lower seal\ncompetence is recorded in the strata with large D\nor moderate C, D, and E values. High values of D\nand E can be related with sandy, bedded horizons\nwith reservoir potential. They can also correlate\nwith the presence of fluids (bright spots), further\npresenting the CDE method as a valid approach to\ncharacterize MTDs in terms of their reservoir po-\ntential and seal competence. By using this same\nmethod for successive intervals, one can estimate\nthe degree of internal organization, continuity (or,\ninstead, chaos), and reflectivity of any type of\nsubsurface strata.",
