        "text": "A critical shortcoming of determining co-occurrence probability texture features using Haralick’s popular grey\nlevel co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is the excessive computational burden. In this paper, the design, implementation,\nand testing of a more efﬁcient algorithm to perform this task are presented. This algorithm, known as the grey level\nco-occurrence integrated algorithm (GLCIA), is a dramatic improvement on earlier implementations. This algorithm\nis created by integrating the preferred aspects of two algorithms: the grey level co-occurrence hybrid structure (GLCHS)\nand the grey level co-occurrence hybrid histogram (GLCHH). The GLCHS utilizes a dedicated two-dimensional\ndata structure to quickly generate the probabilities and apply statistics to generate the features. The GLCHH uses a\nmore efﬁcient one-dimensional data structure to perform the same tasks. Since the GLCHH is faster than the GLCHS\nyet the GLCHH is not able to calculate features using all available statistics, the integration of these two methods\ngenerates a superior algorithm (the GLCIA). The computational gains vary as a function of window size, quanti-\nzation level, and statistics selected. Using a variety of test parameters, experiments indicate that the GLCIA requires a\nfraction (27–54%) of the computational time compared to using the GLCHS alone. The GLCIA computational time\nrelative to that of the standard GLCM method ranges from 0.04% to 16%. The GLCIA is a highly recommended\ntechnique for anyone wishing to calculate co-occurrence probability texture features, especially from large digital\nimages.\nr 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Unser (1986) investigated\nsum and difference histograms to store the co-occurring\ndata, which are efﬁcient relative to using matrices. No\ncomputational comparisons\nwith\nthe\nGLCM\nwere\nperformed, but the theory clearly indicates a dramatic\nreduction in the computational time relative to the\nGLCM. Clausi and Jernigan (1998) reduce the compu-\ntational time relative to the GLCM computational time\nby presenting a grey level co-occurrence linked list\n(GLCLL) structure that stores the non-zero co-occur-\nring probabilities in a sorted linked list. An advancement\non the GLCLL is illustrated by Svolos and Todd-\nPokropek (1998) where a tree data structure is used to\nstore the co-occurring probabilities. This represents a\nreduction in the computational demands since the tree\nstructure search has computational order O(log m)\ncompared to O(m) of the GLCLL approach. Computa-\ntional order is a standard technique to estimate the total\nnumber of calculations required to perform a particular\nalgorithm. Another computational improvement on the\nGLCLL is the grey level co-occurrence hybrid structure\n(GLCHS) (Clausi and Zhao, 2002). The GLCHS is more\nefﬁcient than the GLCLL since it avoids the need for\nmaintaining sorted linked lists by using a combined hash\ntable and linked list data structure.\nIn this paper, the sum and difference histograms are\nimplemented using a GLCHS framework. The resulting\nimplementation (the grey level co-occurrence hybrid\nhistogram (GLCHH)) is demonstrated to reduce the\ncomputational demands relative to the GLCHS alone.\nHowever, the sum and difference histograms are not\nable to act as a basis to use all of Haralick’s statistics\nexactly.

        "text": "Consequently, an integrated method called the grey\nlevel co-occurrence integrated algorithm (GLCIA) is\ncreated, which offers a dramatically improved solution\nby combining the GLCHS and GLCHH methods. Fig. 1\nillustrates the research history leading to the develop-\nment of the GLCIA.\nThe quantization level (where G indicates the number\nof grey levels) is an important consideration when\ndetermining co-occurrence texture features. Quantiza-\ntion was originally used in the co-occurrence texture\nmethod to minimize memory needs and to increase the\ncomputational speed. A certain degree of quantization\nalso reduces noise; however, signiﬁcant quantization can\ndestroy pertinent signal content (Clausi, 2002; Soh and\nTsatsoulis, 1999). The GLCM method is highly sensitive\nto the number of grey levels, given that the computa-\ntional complexity is proportional to OðG2Þ (Clausi\nand Jernigan, 1998). The GLCIA algorithm’s computa-\ntional performance will be shown to be not as sensitive\nto G as previous methods. As a result, there is interest\nin using the GLCIA algorithm in commercial remote-\nsensing software packages to reduce the number of\ncomputations\nfor\nvarious\nG:\nFor\nexample,\nPCI’s\nGeomaticar software constrains G to 16 grey levels\nwhen\nproducing\nco-occurrence\ntexture\nfeatures,\nwhich can reduce their effectiveness since recent re-\nsearch recognizes the need for a greater number of\nquantization levels for discriminating SAR sea ice\nimagery, e.g. G ¼ 24 (Clausi, 2002) and G ¼ 64 (Soh\nand Tsatsoulis, 1999).\nThis paper will ﬁrst brieﬂy discuss the individual\nalgorithms used as a basis for the GLCIA. This leads to\nthe development of the GLCHH design. From this, the\ndesign and implementation of the novel GLCIA is\npresented. Computational speed testing is performed to\ncompare different algorithms. Also, the GLCIA is\napplied to a 1000 \u0004 1000 pixel image to demonstrate\ntotal computation time required for a full image. A\nsummary concludes the paper.",

If one\nwanted to determine texture features using only the\nstatistic CON, n ¼ 25; and G ¼ 64; then approximately\n5% of the GLCHS computing time would be required.\nIf a GLCM is used for the same purpose, this would\namount to 9.1 \u0004 5–0.46% of the time required (using\nTable 4 of Clausi and Zhao (2002)).\nReasons for the overall improvement of GLCIA\ncompared to GLCHS can be motivated by considering\nthe average linked list lengths across each sample\nwindow in the image using GLCHS, GLCHSH, and\nGLCHDH (Table 5). The terms in parentheses represent\nthe percentage of the indicated linked list length with\nrespect to the maximum possible linked list length for\nthat particular implementation (i.e. if a lower triangle\nGLCM implementation was used). The linked list\nlengths follow predictable patterns: increasing G or\nincreasing n increases the average linked list lengths. As\nmentioned earlier and demonstrated here, longer linked\nlists require additional computational time to maintain\nthe list (adding and deleting of nodes) and to apply the\nstatistics.\nWith increasing window size, the relative linked list\nlength between GLCHDH and GLCHS as well as\nGLCHSH and GLCHS decreases. For example, given\nG ¼ 128 grey levels and n ¼ 5 pixels, the GLCHDH\naverage linked list length is 12.9 and that of the GLCHS\nis 17.4 (a ratio of 0.74). At n ¼ 30; this ratio becomes",

Although not tested, it is reasonable to assume\nthat larger images would have a linear increase in the\ncomputational time. For example, a 2000 \u0004 2000 image\nwould require approximately 4 min to process. By\nconsidering the results for the GLCHS algorithm (Clausi\nand Zhao, 2002, Table 4), the GLCIA algorithm will\nrequire (given all eight statistics and depending on\nquantization\nand\nwindow\nsize)\n0.04–16%\nof\nthe\ncomputation time required by the GLCM. For the\npreferred\nquantization\nlevels\nof\nGX32\n(Soh\nand\nTsatsoulis, 1999; Clausi, 2002), this is reduced to the\nrange 0.05–5.0%. If statistics that do not require the\nGLCHS are used (i.e. MAX, ENT, and UNI are not\nused) and GX32; then the GLCIA algorithm requires\n0.04–1.3% of the GLCM computation time.\nThe GLCIA code fundamentally completes two tasks\ngiven a particular window: determine the probabilities\nand then apply the statistics to the probabilities to\ngenerate the texture features. The second and third\ncolumn pairs in Table 6 indicate an approximation of\nthe amount of time and its associated percentage of the\ntotal time required to determine the probabilities. For\nENT, using the GLCHS, which generates longer linked\nlists than the GLCHH, close to 10% (or 56 s) of the\ncomputational time is spent determining the probabil-\nities. The rest of the time (482 s) is spent applying the\nstatistics. CON, on the other hand, uses 80% (37 s) of its\ncomputational time to determine its GLCHDHs, with\n10 s spent on applying the statistic. Anytime the GLCHS\nis required, signiﬁcant computing is required to apply\nthe statistics relative to the GLCHH. Using GLCHHs\nrequires approximately the same amount of time to\ngenerate the probabilities as the GLCHSs (note the 59 s\nfor COR and 56 s for ENT); however, the considerably\nshorter linked lists of the GLCHHs allows the applica-\ntion of the statistics to proceed much faster.\nThese results indicate that the GLCIA is a substantial\nimprovement on earlier implementations for rapid\ndetermination\nof\nco-occurrence\nprobability\ntexture\nfeatures. This method would also be an improvement\non the binary tree implementation by Svolos and Todd-\nPokropek (1998) since the binary tree requires O(log m)\n(where m is the cardinality of the set of elements stored\nin the tree) to store the probabilities while the GLCHS\n(using a hash table) requires only O(1).",
