        "text": "Ramps and ﬂats reﬂect variations in the morphology of basal shear surfaces in mass-transport deposits\n(MTDs), which are often mapped without considering their potential as strain markers. In this work ramps\nand ﬂats are mapped on the margins of salt diapirs, using a high-quality 3D seismic volume from SE Brazil\n(Espírito Santo) to investigate how the morphology of mass-transport deposits (MTDs) relates to diapir growth\nand near-seaﬂoor strain. In parallel, aspect ratios of MTDs are used to estimate their source areas and possible\ncausal mechanisms. Our results show diapir-related MTDs to have length/width ratios ≤3, in a region where sed-\niment failure was triggered by faulting and seaﬂoor tilting due to halokinesis. Sections of MTDs that were trig-\ngered and later uplifted on the ﬂanks of growing diapirs are termed ‘drag zones’. Ramps within this drag zones\nare shown as local changes in gradient at the basal shear surfaces, and are linked to promontories and older\nfault scarps. The results in this paper are important because they show that drag zones are elongated in a\nNW–SE direction, parallel to the dominant trend of basal ramps and promontories. Basal ramps and promonto-\nries in these drag zones constitute markers for seaﬂoor strain around growing salt diapirs, with variations in the\ninternal character of MTDs occurring across these same ramps and promontories. As a result, a spectrum of seis-\nmic and depositional facies can occur in speciﬁc quadrants of drag zones. In the study area are identiﬁed debrites\n(DBs), slightly deformed blocks (SDBs), coherent or unrotated blocks (CUBs), and rafted blocks (RBs).\n© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Following seaﬂoor\nfailure, which occurs when downslope-directed shear stress exceed the\nshear strength of seaﬂoor sediment (Varnes, 1978; Richardson et al.,\n2011), mass-wasting processes involve the transport of sediment over a\nbasal shear surface (Lucente and Pini, 2003) or gliding plane (Gee et al.,\n2005). Once failure is initiated, sediment will move at different velocities\nand volumes over the basal shear surface until the inertia of failed mate-\nrial is balanced once again by glide plane shear strength (Richardson et al.,\n2011).\nKinematic indicators such as scours (Nissen et al., 1999; Posamentier\nand Kolla, 2003; Weimer and Shipp, 2004), grooves and striations (Gee\net al., 2005, 2006), cat claws (Moscardelli et al., 2006), monkey ﬁngers\n(Mc Gilvery and Cook, 2003), ramps and ﬂats (Gawthorpe and",

Basal ramps form segments of a\nshear surface that are discordant with underlying bedding planes,\nwhile ﬂats comprise the bedding-parallel portion of the surface. Ramps\nand ﬂats generally run perpendicular to the ﬂow or movement direction\n(Trincardi and Argnani, 1990) and are seldom parallel to the ﬂow direc-\ntion (O'Leary, 1986, 2002; Bull et al., 2009). As the failed strata move\nacross ramps, signiﬁcant deformation in the sediment is observed at\nthe shear surface (Ramsay and Huber, 1987), usually in the form of\nslump folds and complex compressional features (Rupke, 1967;\nFrey-Martinez et al., 2005; Alves and Lourenço, 2010).\nIn addition to basal shear surface deformation, circular and ellipti-\ncal features interpreted on seismic volumes provide evidence of local\n(paleo) stresses associated with compression, extension, or both.\nThey are usually associated with near-seaﬂoor folding (Edwards et\nal., 2005), salt diapirs (Stewart, 2006), mud volcanoes (Medialdea et\nal., 2000; Milkov, 2000; Dimitrov, 2002), igneous/volcanic plumes\n(Garfunkel and Ben-Avraham, 1996), extension/polygonal faulting\nor sandstone intrusions (Shoulders et al., 2007). Salt diapirs, mud volca-\nnoes and folds are generally associated with compressional stresses with\nminimum stress oriented in a vertical direction (Stewart, 2006). Such a\nstress distribution is recorded in the form of complex deformation\naround growing diapirs, which translates at the seaﬂoor as slope",

The study\narea is separated from the Mucuri and Cumuruxatiba basins by the\nAbrolhos plateau, a volcanic plateau originating in the Eocene. To the\nsouth, the basin gradually extends into the Campos Basin (Ojeda,\n1982; Chang et al., 1992; Fiduk et al., 2004). As most sedimentary basins\nin the South Atlantic, the tectonic evolution of the Espírito Santo Basin is\ndivided into four stages (Fig. 2). A pre-rift stage of Late Jurassic to\nBerriasian age is followed by the syn-rift stage (Berriasian–Late Aptian).\nThe transitional stage spans the late Aptian to Early Albian, and the drift\nstage starting in the Early Albian up to the Holocene (Ojeda, 1982; Gibbs\net al., 2003) (Fig. 2). Additional tectonic elements that modify the basin\narchitecture include salt fairways, intrusive and extrusive magmatism,\nand sediment canyons (Fiduk et al., 2004).\nEvaporites were deposited in the Espírito Santo Basin from the late\nAptian to the early Albian, within the ‘transitional stage’ (Demercian\net al., 1993). These evaporites were later deformed by a combination\nof differential sediment loading, gravity spreading and downslope\ngravity gliding (Demercian et al., 1993; Fiduk et al., 2004). As a result\nof such a complex halokinesis, six salt fairways were developed off-\nshore Espírito Santo (Fiduk et al., 2004). Included in these fairways\nare composite structures such as salt rollers, vertical salt diapirs,\nallochthonous salt canopies, shallow canopies coalescing from the com-\nbination of two different tongues, deep salt canopies, and thrusted salt\nnappes (Fiduk et al., 2004). The area of interest to this study lies in the\nregion of the vertical salt diapirs (Fig. 2). Some of these diapirs ceased\ntheir movement in Cretaceous times, while others are still growing\nand exposing their crests on the seaﬂoor (Fiduk et al., 2004).\nCenozoic successions in the Espírito Santo Basin are composed of\naggrading strata deposited during transgressive and highstand episodes\n(Mohriak, 1995). Prograding strata marking regressive episodes and\nperiods of submarine canyon incision are observed in seven speciﬁc\ntime intervals (Fiduk et al., 2004; Moreira and Carminatti, 2004). As a\nresult, thick carbonate and clastic sequences were accumulated on the\ncontinental shelf during the late Cenozoic, with important volumes of\nstrata prograding to the region where the study area is located (Fig. 2).\nIn such a setting, mass-wasting events in the interpreted seismic volume",

Two-way travel time (TWTT) thickness maps\nwere generated to identify any thickness variations in the interpreted\nMTDs (Fig. 3). These maps were also helpful to recognise any changes\nin the geometry of MTDs, areas with blocky strata, regions affected by\nextension, and basal ramps and ﬂats. Length/width aspect ratios of the\nMTDs were used to deduce their possible causal mechanisms and con-\nnection with the continental slope and shelf.\nRoot-mean square (RMS) amplitude maps were generated to high-\nlight the presence of high-amplitude strata and associated structural\nfabrics. RMS amplitude maps calculate average amplitude values by\nsquaring individual data samples over a deﬁned time window, boosting\nany high amplitude in the mapped interval (cf. Brown, 2004). These\nattribute maps can emphasise structural fabric because seismic wave-\nlets are diminished across basal ramps as a result of the destructive\ninterference of seismic energy (Fairbairn and Ward, 1984) and the in-\ncomplete reﬂection of energy from the Fresnel Zones on both sides of\nthe ramps (Townsend et al., 1998).

In\naddition, these same regions are characterised by ramps of variable\ndimensions (Figs. 3, 5 and 8).\nTime-structure maps were used to describe the morphological di-\nvision of individual MTDs into their headwall, translational and toe do-\nmains. Changes in dip associated with basal shear surfaces were\nunderlined using time-dip maps (Fig. 5). The latter maps highlight\nchanges in dip of an interpreted seismic reﬂection. Since ramps offset\nnear-seaﬂoor strata, a continuous interpretation across the ramps will re-\nsult in a change in dip of the interpreted horizon, provided the vertical\nresolution is high enough to resolve the offset (Yilmaz, 1987). How abrupt\nthe change in dip across a ramp is, depends on the bin size of the seismic\nvolume as well as its lateral resolution (Yilmaz, 1987).\nIn order to understand the mode of formation of basal ramps and\nhow they relate to observed promontories, the thickness of the MTDs\nwas estimated within individual depressions, or coves as named in\nthis work, created by ramps and promontories (Figs. 4b and 5b). In ad-\ndition, the lengths of distinct ramps, the widths of coves and of adjacent\npromontories were measured as a way to estimate the erosion power of\nthe investigated MTDs. Correlation coefﬁcients between the width of\ncoves and the maximum thickness of MTDs were calculated for the\nstudy area. The transporting distance of MTDs along slope, and the diam-\neters of the associated salt diapir were also correlated. Axial ratios of in-\nferred drag zones near the crest of the salt diapirs were computed based\non time-dip and RMS amplitude data. Finally, the trends of their long\naxes were measured and plotted on rose diagrams (Fig. 8d).\nCoherence maps at the base of the MTDs were also used to validate\nthe position of ramps observed on time-dip maps (Fig. 5). Coherence is\na measure of the waveform similarity, i.e. how a trace is similar to its\nneighbouring trace. Similar traces are mapped as high coherence coefﬁ-\ncients while discontinuities have low coefﬁcients (Brown, 2004).",

It also pro-\nvides important hints on the volume of sediment remobilised during\nslope instability events. Based on this assumption, aspect ratios were\npreviously used to classify MTDs as ‘slope-detached’ and ‘attached’ off-\nshore Trinidad and Tobago (Moscardelli and Wood, 2007), and in the\nanalysis of Quaternary submarine landslides on the US Atlantic margin\n(Twichell et al., 2009). Slope- and shelf-attached MTDs are of regional\nscale, covering thousands of kilometres in area and are generally\nsourced from extra-basinal systems such as shelf-edge deltas and\nupper-slope regions (Moscardelli and Wood, 2007). In contrast,\ndetached MTDs are relatively small and conﬁned to the margins of\nminibasins or bathymetric highs. Irrespective of the volume of\nremobilised strata, slope detached MTDs have speciﬁc aspect ratios of\nb4 (Moscardelli and Wood, 2007; Twichell et al., 2009). Slope-attached\nMTDs usually have longer run out distances and invariably high length/\nwidth ratios relative to those detached from the slope or shelf.\nThe methods in Moscardelli and Wood (2007) and Twichell et al.\n(2009) are valid when classifying MTDs on continental margins\nwhere the headwall scarp is imperceptible and, as in the case of the\nstudy area, salt structures are prominent and well-developed\n(Figs. 4 and 12). However, this work highlights the existence of quad-\nrants on the margins of rising diapirs in which the MTDs' lithology\nand internal characters signiﬁcantly vary. In addition, these same\nquadrants are shown to comprise the regions on the slope recording\nthe higher recurrence of MTDs (Fig. 12b). This is a signiﬁcant piece\nof new information that will be discussed in detail in the following\nsections.\nIn this study, all the MTDs have length/width ratios of b3 with the\nheadwall scarp and toe regions prominently-imaged. The lack of\nheadwall scarps in MTD 2 may imply quick burial, evacuation and\nlater inﬁlling of the headwall region by subsequent and younger\nMTDs, or a distal source for the failed material. This latter interpreta-\ntion is favoured by the homogeneous nature of MTD 2. This MTD\nstarted out as heterogeneous combination of different facies (slides,\nslumps and debris ﬂow deposits) and, consequent to its long travel\ndistance, ended up as an homogeneous debrite (Fig. 12).",

        "text": "The reactivation of previously-formed radial faults and the growth of\nnewer faults within salt withdrawal basins triggered the deposition of\nMTD 3 during the Miocene–Oligocene. Rafted blocks up to 400 m in\nheight are prominent near the inferred headwall region (Fig. 10a).\nSome of these blocks can be markedly faulted, with their size decreasing\ntowards the toe region. The lack of an obviously-extended headwall\nregion implies that materials could have failed homogeneously on the\nﬂanks of diapirs (Dykstra, 2005).\nIn contrast, the youngest MTD 4 was formed in the Miocene by con-\ntinued halokinesis and faulting. The headwall region of MTD 4 lies be-\ntween D2 and D3 (Figs. 4f and 5d). The post Miocene reactivation of\nD2 led to an elevated slope gradient and the subsequent collapse of\nsediments on the south-eastern margin of the diapir.\nThe four interpreted MTDs are thus characteristic slope-detached\nMTDs presumably resulting from instability generated by increasing\nslope angles on the ﬂanks of growing salt diapirs. Sliding on the plane\nof failure was promoted by near-seaﬂoor faulting and salt diapirism.\nThey are also found within, or restricted to, salt withdrawal basins\nformed on the ﬂanks of rising diapirs. They were generated close to\nthe present-day salt diapirs and as such can be described as\nlocally-sourced MTDs.",

In such a setting,\nsalt diapirs preferentially grew adjacently to the observed promontories.\nA possible explanation for the presence of Type II ramps is that they\nwere created by the action of multiple beds cut by pre-existing fault\nscarps (Fig. 11c). Type II ramps are, however, preferentially oriented in\nthe direction of transport of the interpreted MTDs. Consequently, we in-\nterpret these ramps to pre-date or occur synchronously with the depo-\nsition of MTDs 1 to 4 (Fig. 11a). In addition, the orientation of the fault\ncontrolled ramps was directly controlled by halokinesis. Salt mounds,\ndiapirs and associated crestal and radial faults propagated to the south\neast in areas of lower head gradient (cf.

Drag zones are\ntherefore considered to mark the area of maximum strain endured\nby the paleo seaﬂoor during the diapir growth. On the RMS amplitude\nmap, they are materialised as coherently distributed zones of uplift/\ndrag characterised by changes amplitude (Fig. 9). In addition, subtle\nlow amplitude linear features, or scars, observed around some of\nthe diapirs on RMS amplitude maps correspond to the position of\nbasal ramps (Fig. 9).\nQuantifying these drag zones provided insight into the distribution\nof strain within the MTD during halokinesis. Where present, ramps\nalso inﬂuenced the geometry and type of the ﬁnal drag zone. In this\npaper is shown a spectrum of MTD facies in drag zones with developed\nramps. As drag zones represent the maximum strained section of MTD\ndeposited during salt diapir rise, their analysis can be used to under-\nstand if MTDs were deposited before or during salt diapir movement.\nThe relative lack of ﬂow structures such as deﬂected, reﬂected or imbri-\ncated MTD layers around the diapirs suggest mass ﬂows that are not but-\ntressed against a structural or topographic barrier (see Fig. 11a). In\naddition, the diapirs are found in the translational domain of MTDs\nwhich may indicate no signiﬁcant alteration of the stress regime during\nthe diapir growth. Also, piercements of the MTD connote deformation\nof the overburden, especially during the active stage of diapirism.\nIn contrast to the latter settings, basal ramps sub-parallel to drag\nzones' long axes indicate the accommodation of local strain on the\nﬂanks of diapirs when of the deposition of MTDs.

These ramps include those attached to\npromontories, and fault-controlled ramps that either predated or oc-\ncurred synchronously with the deposition of MTDs. Ramps with prom-\nontories formed by the erosion of the least competent part of the basal\nshear surface. When there is complete erosion of the incompetent layer,\nthey are manifested as structures normal to the direction of mass ﬂow\nand parallel during partial erosion. Furthermore, the action of multiple\nbeds and incomplete erosion of underlying fault scarps was linked\nwith the formation of fault-controlled ramps.\nThe salt diapir rise and subsequent strain histories of the mass trans-\nport deposits are preserved in drag zones within the MTD on the crest of\nthe diapirs. Distinct MTD facies were preferentially deposited in different\nquadrants of drag zones. The estimated axial ratios of drag zones were es-\ntimated to be b1.5, 1.5–2.0, and 2.00; with the long axes mainly oriented\nin NW–SE direction. Additionally, the location of drag zones and MTD fa-\ncies was inﬂuenced by the position of basal ramps. The orientation (ϕ) of\nthe long axes and axial ratios of the drag zone were important parameters\nfor investigating the strain history of the paleo seaﬂoor and the MTDs.\nThese zones are strain markers, which could only be analysed by estima-\ntion of their aspect ratios.
