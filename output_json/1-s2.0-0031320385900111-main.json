The length of the run is the number of pixels \nin the run. Previous applications have extracted run \nlengths by making one-dimensional scans across an \nimage at a few angles. Statistics calculated from these \nrun lengths have been used to segment or identify the \nimage. \nParticular characteristics of seismic sections must be \nconsidered in the design of a run-length algorithm for \nseismic data. First, runs on a seismic section corre- \nspond to reflections many of which tend to be nearly \nhorizontal. The algorithm used here finds run lengths \nalong reflection events for a range of angles centered \non zero degrees. Second, a seismic section is com- \nplicated by the wide range of positive and negative \npixel values. To simplify the image, amplitude values \nlarger than a positive threshold are replaced by 'ones' \nand values less than the threshold are replaced by \n'zeros'. The result is a binary gray-tone level image \nwhere the 'ones' correspond to the dark streaks \n(positive reflections) in the section. Our run-length \nalgorithm operates on this simplified image. \nThe amplitude threshold was chosen by examining \nbinary images for a range of thresholds. The threshold \nshould be low enough so that the image retains texture \ncharacter but high enough to insure that the noise does \nnot create artificial runs. A value somewhat close to the \nmean of the histogram of amplitude values was used in \nour numerical tests. The results of the algorithm are \ninsensitive to changes of + 30% in this value. It is \nexpected that a single value could be used for seismic \nlines of similar acquisition and processing.",

When positive signals \noverlap in time the operation outputs a positive signal \nfor the duration of the overlap of both signals. When \nthey do not overlap, the operation corresponds to the \n'and' operation in Boolean algebra. Computationally \nthe (,) operation is the successive addition of shifts and \nmultiplies with all non-zero output samples norma- \nlized to one. The shifts are done to account for sloping \nreflectors over a range of slope (dip). The quantity \nT 1 • (T l • T2)is then equal to those pixels of T~ which \ncorrespond to pixels of T2 over a range of reflector dip. \nIn our numerical examples we have used a range of dip \nof _+45 °. We translate this into the appropriate \napparent dip on the seismic image. The look-forward \nloop is now modified to: \nRUN LENGTH CALCULATION",

Region 4, on the other hand, is charac- \nterized by chaotic reflections and line noise with \nvariable orientations. \nGeologically, the top of region 4 represents roughly \nthe base-of-reflectors in the Gulf of Mexico. It includes \nshale ridges and salt. domes. The progression from \nregion 1 to 2 to 3 is influenced by the general \ncompaction of sediments with depth. \nThe results of applying the template-matching al- \ngorithm to the section shown in Fig. I is displayed in \nFig. 3. Three templates per region were chosen from \nthe section for the analysis. The square box symbol (F-]) \nindicates region 1, the cross ( x ) region 2, the triangle \n(A) region 3. The lines drawn on Fig. 3 are the \nsegrnentation boundaries from the manual interpret- \nation shown on Fig. 1. The algorithm finds that most of \nregion 4 does not correlate well with templates from \nany region and thus it is easily classified. That is, region \n4 corresponds in almost all cases to the unclassified \npart of the image. There are some isolated unclassified \nblocks which do not correspond to region 4. \nIn general, this algorithm tends to confuse structural \ndip with signal character. Thus a large part of region 2 \nis classified as region 3. Similarly the classification of \nregion I is very sporadic, probably due to the varia- \nbility of the signal across the region. \nFigures 4-6 show the results of applying thc run- \nlength algorithm. Figure 4 shows the binary image \nobtained from Fig. 1 by applying a threshold on the \ndata. Clearly this image has preserved the horizontal \nrun-length characteristics of the original image. The \nrun-length statistics as applied to Fig. 4 are shown on \nFi& 5 along with straight-line boundaries used to \nclassify the data. These boundaries have been chosen \nmanually by examining where points, corresponding \nto blocks from a given region of the image, cluster in \nthis two dimensional parameter space.

Both methods treat the section as an image not \ninfluenced by the order of geologic events which \ngenerally characterize the entire region from which the \nsection is only a piece. Therefore, as an extension to \neither of the two methods discussed earlier, an intelli- \ngent 'decision-process' called the RESOLVER is added \n(Fig. 7). The RESOLVER attempts to add some \nartificial intelligence to the classification process by \nmodelling heuristic constraints that a human interpre- \nter would use while segmenting a seismic section. An \ninterpreter, for instance, is aware that regions to be \nsegmented are contiguous areas that are com- \nposed ofseverai classification blocks. His classification \nof a particular block is strongly influenced by the \npotential classification of neighboring blocks. An \ninterpreter might also have geologic information re- \nlated to the depositional sequence of the various \nregions in the section. All this information is indepen- \ndent of whatever image texture he sees and may even \nprejudice what he thinks he sees. It is clearly indepen- \ndent of our statistical assessment of texture. \nHeuristic information, like the above, can be im- \nplemented as rules which alter the degree-of- \nmembership, a measure of to what extent a particular \nblock of pixels belongs to a certain region. As an \nexample, the following four rules can be used in a \nRESOLVER which can be applied to the data shown \nin Fig. 2. \nRule I. The depth prejudice rule. It is unlikely that a",

This rule is related to the effect of sediment \ncompaction on seismic signal character. \nRule 2. The sequence rule. In a vertical column of \nblocks, if the block directly above a block in question is \nclassified as region 2, then it is unlikely that the block \nin question belongs to region 1. The same applies for \nregion 2 with respect to region 3. \nRule 3. Region 4 shape rule. Region 4 is a solid figure \ninstead of a layer. That is, it is composed of salt domes \nand shale ridges. It is improbable that a block is in \nregion 4 if the blocks above and below that block are \nclassified other than 4. This rule is related to the \nexpected topology of the image. That is, a diapir is \nexpected to have nearly vertical sides. \nRule 4. The neighbors rule. If among the nearest eight \nneighbors around a block in question the majority \n(/> 4) are assigned to a particular region, then it is very \nlikely that the block in question belongs to the same \nregion. \nWe will now illustrate how these rules can be \nimplemented in a RESOLVER which takes as input a \nseismic section which has been processed by the run- \nlength algorithm. \nAs a first step, the run-length algorithm discussed \nabove is modified to yield for each block of data pixels \na vector D containing the degrees-of-membership (on \na scale from 0 to 1) of that block to all regions in the \nsection. The ith entry di in the vector, corresponds to \nthe degree-of-membership of the block in region i. The \ndegr~-of-membership in a region is calculated from \nthe position of the (R MS-run-length, average-spacing) \npoint for a block of pixeis on the plot shown in Fig. 5. \nIn each of the four regions, a small rectangular area in \nthe RMS-run-length, average-spacing plane (Fig. 5) is \nassumed to contain points which are correctly classi- \nfied (membership = l) as belonging to that region. \nPoints outside a larger rectangular area are assumed \nto have zero membership in that region. A linear \ninterpolation (see Fig. 8) between the boundaries of \nthese areas based on the position of the point is used to \ncalculate the degree-of-membership of the point in the \nregion.

The initial node is expanded by application of \neach of the four heuristic rules. The subsequent states \nare compared with a goal state which requires one \nblock to have a degree-of-membership above a mini- \nmum threshold and all other degrees-of-membership \nbelow a different lower threshold. If none of the states \nmeets this goal the search continues by expanding the \nnode which is closest to it. Note that only the rules that \nhave not been applied to that point in the search are \nused to expand to the next depth. \nAt each level in the search the rule which changes the \nstate so as to bring it 'closest' to the goal state is the one \nused in the expansion.

The first are the changes in degrees-of- \nmemberships that a particular rule produces. The \nsecond are the thresholds, d,,,x and d,,~,, which deter- \nmine whether a goal state has been achieved. Modify- \ning the degree-of-membership changes allows for \nrelative weighting between the rules. If the thresholds \nare made more stringent relative to these changes, the \nRESOLVER is forced to apply more rules before \nreaching the goal state. \nApplying the above to the Gulf of Mexico example \ndiscussed earlier, we used equal changes of 0.2 in the \ndegrees-of-membership due to the application of a \nrule, a maximum threshold of d,,., = 0.5 for a given \nregion, and a minimum threshold for all others ofd H \n= 0.3. Our aim was to maximize the number of rules \napplied but limit the number of blocks left unclassified.",

Note further that \ndip variations in region 2 easily dominated other \neffects like reflector spacing, and may lead to good \ncorrelations with templates from region 3. It seems \nnecessary then to carefully choose texture measures \nwhich are strongly influenced only by common charac- \nteristics in a region. It is as important to choose what \nfeatures of a region to ignore (e.g. dip) as it is which \nones to include. This ability to ignore certain features is \none of the strengths of the human interpreter which is \nnot often easy to duplicate in a numerical algorithm. \nThe algorithm based on run-length seems more \npowerful than the template-matching scheme for this \ndata. This is probably because of the inherent sensitiv- \nity of data templates to any variability in the data. \nBoth methods discussed have a spatial resolution \nproblem. In each case, blocks of data about a pixel \ncomprise the basic analysis unit. The size of these \nblocks is affected by several factors. Textural infor- \nmation is enhanced by making the blocks longer in the \nvertical direction. Increased size horizontally tends to \nrepeat the same reflectors thus adding only statistical \nweight to the textural measure. Larger vertical length \ntends to smear across region boundaries creating \nblocks with intermediary statistics. This last effect is",
