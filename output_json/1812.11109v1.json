        "text": "The identiﬁcation of salt dome boundaries in migrated seismic data volumes is im-\nportant for locating petroleum reservoirs. The presence of noise in the data makes\ncomputer-aided salt dome interpretation even more challenging. In this paper, we de-\nvelop noise-robust algorithms that can label boundaries of salt domes both eﬀectively\nand eﬃciently. Our research is twofold. First, we utilize a texture-based gradient to\naccomplish salt dome detection. We show that by employing a dissimilarity measure\nbased on two-dimensional (2D) discrete Fourier transform (DFT), the algorithm is ca-\npable of eﬃciently detecting salt dome boundaries with accuracy. At the same time,\nour analysis shows that the proposed algorithm is robust to noise. Once the detection\nis performed for an initial 2D seismic section, we propose to track the initial bound-\naries through the data volume to accomplish an eﬃcient labeling process by avoiding\nparameters tuning that would have been necessary if detection had been performed\nfor every seismic section. The tracking process involves a tensor-based subspace learn-\ning process, in which we build texture tensors using patches from diﬀerent seismic\nsections. To accommodate noise components with various levels in a texture tensor,\nwe employ noise-adjusted principal component analysis (NA-PCA), so that principal\ncomponents corresponding to greater signal-to-noise ratio values may be selected for\ntracking. We validate our detection and tracking algorithms through experiments using\nseismic datasets acquired from Netherland oﬀshore F3 block in the North Sea with very\nencouraging results.",

Such structure\nis characterized by certain attributes.\nHowever, calculating these attributes accurately\nand eﬃciently faces many challenges. First, the data are subjected to a long processing\npipeline of stacking and migration. Not only do these steps introduce artifacts, but they\nmay magnify noise in the raw data. Second, the raw data are an undersampled depiction of\nthe subsurface structure. This is analogous to detecting detailed activities from low-quality\nvideos captured with a low-resolution camera. Third, noise in the data volume can be a\nfunction of the subsurface structure, and it may contain information about the subsurface\nstructure. Instead of denoising, our long-term plan is to take advantage of such noise.",

First, we deﬁne a\ntexture-based attribute, namely gradient of texture (GoT), and combine it with a dissim-\nilarity measure based on 2D discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to implement an algorithm\ncapable of detecting salt dome boundaries with high accuracy and eﬃciency. We further\nanalyze and show that the proposed algorithm is robust to noise. Once salt dome detection\nis performed for an initial 2D seismic section, we propose to track the initial boundaries\nthrough the data volume to accomplish the labeling process. This way, we can avoid tweak-\ning parameters for boundary detection in every seismic section, thus being more eﬃcient.\nThe tracking involves a tensor-based subspace learning process. It starts by forming texture\ntensors according to the initially labeled boundaries, to better capture the strong correlation",

However, extra labor and time involved\nin the tuning of parameters may lower interpretation eﬃciency. Therefore, to avoid the\nfrequent adjustment of parameters, we group seismic sections into reference and predicted\nsections by borrowing the ideas of I- and P-frames from video-coding techniques and apply\nthe proposed detection method only to reference sections that constitute the minority of\nseismic sections. By tracking detected boundaries in reference sections through a seismic\nvolume, we can synthesize salt dome boundaries in predicted sections with limited human\nintervention.

The block diagram of the proposed tracking process is\nshown in Figure 10. The reconstruction error et is calculated as follows:",

However, in real cases, it is possible that migrated seismic sections contain various\nlevels of noise. If we still depend on the MPCA-based tracking method, extracted features\ncorresponding to the most variations of texture tensors may have low signal-to-noise ratios\n(SNRs). Therefore, the appearance of noise may reduce the accuracy of tracked bound-\naries. To deal with this problem, on the basis of Roger’s work (Roger, 1994), we modify the\nproposed tracking strategy and introduce noise-adjusted MPCA (NA-MPCA) that ranks\nprincipal components (PCs) along diﬀerent modes by the SNR rather than the variation.\nSince noise is commonly assumed to be additive, we deﬁne image patches extracted from\nseismic sections as X = S + N, where S is the image patch without noise and N represents\nnoise that are independent to S. In this paper, we estimate the amplitude of noise using\nwavelet-based denoising method (Chang et al., 2000). In addition, we denote the covariance\nmatrices of X, S, and N as ΣX, ΣS, and ΣN, respectively. To arrange PCs in the order\nof SNRs, we need to apply a noise-whitening process that transforms N to identity covari-\nance matrix bN. Therefore, we deﬁne transform matrix P and analyze the noise-whitening\nprocess as follows:\nΣ bN = PT ΣNP = PT V∆NVT P = I,\n(28)",

The added zero-mean Gaussian noise has standard deviations\nranging from 0.01 to 0.05, and Figure 17 illustrates the change of SalSIM indices according to\nthe increasing of standard deviations. For one noise level, we extract the salt dome bound-\naries from noisy seismic sections using either the proposed method or the GLCM-based\ndetection method, and the mean of corresponding SalSIM indices is shown in Figure 17.\nThe error bars of means correspond to an uncertainty equal to one standard deviation, and\nthe dashed curve represents the trend of means. Although the averaged accuracy of salt\ndome boundaries detected by the proposed method decreases slowly with the increasing of\nstandard deviations, it is still greater than those of boundaries detected by the GLCM-based\nmethod at the most of noisy levels. We notice that with the increasing of noise the latter\nﬂuctuates around a certain SalSIM index rather than keep decreasing, the reason for which\nis that the quantization step in the calculation of the GLCM, functioning as a built-in noise\nﬁlter, can weaken the inﬂuence of noise on the GLCM contrast maps. To fairly compare the\nrobustness of these two methods, we apply an edge-preserving smoothing ﬁlter, the bilat-\neral ﬁlter (Tomasi and Manduchi, 1998), to noisy seismic sections and obtain the statistical\nmeasures of corresponding SalSIM indices in Figure 17(a). We notice that with the extra\ndenoising operation, the GoT-based method shows higher accuracy than the GLCM-based\nmethod. If the noise level keeps increasing, depending only on the denoising operation we\nmay not be able to label satisﬁed boundaries from migrated seismic sections. Therefore,\ngeophysicists commonly prefer to regenerate migrated seismic sections with higher quality\nfrom raw seismic data by reducing noise that appears in every preprocessing step (Chopra\nand Marfurt, 2014).",

In contrast, the noise level increases to 0.05 in\npredicted sections. We utilize the manually labeled reference boundary to synthesize tracked\nboundaries in Inline #389 to #409. In Figure 23, We compare boundaries synthesized by\nthe tensor-based tracking method with or without noise adjusted. With the increasing oﬀset\nbetween the reference and predicted sections, the appearance of noise magniﬁes the error\nin the localization of tracked points. Since the noise-adjusted tracking method is robust\nto noise, the diﬀerence of two curves in Figure 23 grows with the increasing oﬀset. The\ntracked boundaries obtained by the former one have a mean of SalSIM indices, 0.9468,\nwhich is greater than that of the boundaries synthesized by the latter one, 0.9396. It shows\nthat the proposed noise-adjusted tracking method can alleviate the inﬂuence of noise and\nenhance the robustness of the tracking process.",

        "text": "In this paper, we propose noise-robust algorithms for detection and tracking of salt domes\nin post-migrated seismic volumes. By utilizing a texture-based gradient and a 2D DFT-\nbased dissimilarity measure, we are able to accomplish noise-robust salt dome detection\nwith both high accuracy and excellent eﬃciency. Then, by tracking a detected boundary\nfrom an initial seismic section through a 3D volume, we further improve the eﬃciency of\nthe labeling process. The tensor-based noise-adjusted subspace learning approach proved\nvery useful for the tracking of salt dome boundaries, especially when noise of varying levels\nis present. Combining together, the detection and tracking algorithms yield a practical salt\ndome labeling system that is eﬀective, eﬃcient, and robust.",
