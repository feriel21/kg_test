        "text": "This article presents a methodology developed to evaluate the instability of \nsubmarine slopes that extend over a large area. Special attention was paid to (1) \nthe complex geometry (bathymetry) and the expanse of the slope, (2) the hetero- \ngeneity of the sediment, and (3) the distribution of the pore pressure. The safety \n,factor was considered as a spatially varying quantity. The General Formulation \n(GLE, Fredlund and Krahn 1977), which fully satisfies equilibrium conditions, \nwas used jor evaluating the stability of the marine slope. The submarine slope fail- \nure, which occurred on 16 October 1979 during the construction of the new Nice \nairport, was studied in order to test the developed model. Geotechnical parameters \nwere taken from experimental tests carried out by IFREMER on 19 cores extracted \nat different depths (from 27m to 1300m) (Cochonat, Bourillet, and Savoye, 1993; \nMulder et al., 1994). Many scenarios were proposed in order to explain the cause of \nthe Nice slope failure (Habib, 1994). In this article, two of those scenarios were \ntested. Simulation results are presented and discussed.",

As \nopposed to on-shore landslides, submarine slides can take place on very gentle \nslopes, even less than one degree. For example, the slump of the Mississippi River \ndelta occurred on a slope with an angle of only 0.5\". Unfortunately, while special \nattention has been focused on the description of new sites of submarine slides (Bern6 \net al., 1998; Coleman and Garrison, 1977; Embley, 1980; Embley and Jacobi, 1977; \nHampton and Bouma, 1977; McGregor, 1977; Orren and Hamilton, 1998), little \nattention has been paid to the comprehension of the processes at the origin of the \nslope instabilities. \nThis article describes a new methodology developed for evaluating the risk of \nmarine slope instability. The instability of submarine slopes may vary significantly \nwith the extent of the slope and the complexity of the bathymetry. In addition, the \nheterogeneity of the hydromechanical characteristics of the sediment can greatly \nmodify slope flow fields, effective-stress fields, and slope stability. Consequently, it \nwas appropriate to evaluate stability as a spatially varying quantity. Moreover, \nmarine slope instability can be an important mechanism for sediment transport \nand deposition. Therefore, it was fundamental to identify the right geometry of \nthe failure surface in order to simulate correctly the sediment transport and the \nturbidity currents.",

        "text": "The continental slope off the coast of Nice is characterized by a very narrow shelf \ngenerally less than 2 kilometers wide. The 1000 m isobath lies only 5 km from the \ncoastline (Savoye el al., 1989), and the steep slope is strongly eroded and dissected by \nseveral canyons and gullies, of which the Var and the Paillon canyons (Figure 1) are \nthe most important features (> 10\" gradient slope and > 2000m deep) (Bourillet, \n1991). Both canyons are directly connected to the Var and Paillon rivers and coalesce \ndownslope to form the Var sedimentary system. \nThe Var sedimentary system covers a surface area of 16200 km2 extending from \nthe coast of the French Riviera between Nice and Monaco to the base of the \nnorthern continental slope of Corsica. It is the most extensive detrital province of \nthe Ligurian Sea. The Var sedimentary system was deposited during the Pliocene and \nQuaternary eras. After the Messinian low stage of the late Miocene era, when sea \nlevel was lowered about 1200m in the area (Piper and Savoye, 1993), the return of \nopen-marine conditions in the Pliocene and the Quaternary resulted in deposition of \na 60&1000 m thick sequence of mark and conglomerates on the continental slope. \nQuaternary uplift and sediment supply from the glaciated Alps resulted in a supply \nof coarse sediments to the fan by the braided Var River throughout the Quaternary \neven at sea level highstands such as at present. \nSediment deposition in the upper continental slope in the Baie des Anges is \nstrongly linked to fluvial input from the Var River, the Paillon River being only a \nminor source. The upper slope is an area experiencing active sediment transport, \nwhere at least three major types of sediment transfer processes are identified \n(Mulder, and Cochonat, 1996): (1) hyperpycnal turbid plumes; (2) surge-like tur- \nbidity currents generated by shallow failure; and (3) large earthquake-triggered \nslides. \nThe submarine slope failure, which occurred in October 1979 during the \nconstruction of the new Nice airport was attributed to the effect of a mass-wasting",

Therefore, we have adopted the Spencer \nassumption of a constant inclination of the interslice force (eq. 19). Since the \nsafety factor cannot be calculated directly from equations 13 through 16, the sol- \nution is determined by two series of iterative numerical procedures. The first iterative \nprocedure is used to calculate FOS, and FOSf, while the second iterative procedure \nis used to find the constant of equation 19 in order to obtain FOS, equal to FOS’for \nthe same failure surface. \nIn a vertical cross-section, each node often belongs to several slip surfaces for \neach of which a safety factor is computed. The minimal of these safety factors (FOS) \nis affected to each node and a map of equal values of FOS can be plotted over the \nwhole vertical cross section (Figure 1 I).",

Two calculations were carried out: (1) for a slope of 45” and a uniform soil \n(Figure 1 la); and (2) for the same slope angle with a heterogeneous soil including a \nweak clay layer (Figure 1 lb). \nIn the first case, the security number ( y H / C ,  where y is the soil density and His \nthe slope height) corresponding to the critical FOS (= 1) is found equal to 5.88 \n(Table 2). In the second case, and for the same security number, the safety factor \nis found equal to 0.64 (Figure llb). The shape of the failure surfaces defined by a \nFOS less than 1 varies between the two calculation cases. In the first case (uniform \nsoil), the shape of the failure surface is quasicircular, while in the second one (weak \nclay layer), the shape is arbitrary and generally reaches the weak clay layer. \nIn order to validate this new methodology in drained and undrained conditions, \ntwo other calculations were carried out for a slope of 30”. The safety factor was \ncalculated under drained condition and undrained condition (9’ \n= 0). Calculation \nresults are presented in Table 2 and Figure 12.

In this \nmethod, the plastic strains are replaced by viscoplastic strains proportional to the \nvalue of the yield curve$ \nThe two cases of Figure 11 were studied by using the finite element method. \nFigure 13a presents the used mesh (8-node quadrilateral elements). The determina- \ntion of the safety factor by using the finite element method consists in calculating the \nmaximum displacement for various values of the factor of safety FOS with which the \nvalues of c and q are divided. In equation 20, c and Tan (o are respectively replaced \nby c/FOS and Tan (oIF0S. The value of FOS corresponding to a sudden increase in \ndisplacement is considered as the safety factor. The failure surface is considered as \nthe area where the yield function is positive (Figure 13b). Comparison between the \nfailure surface determined with the limit equilibrium method (Figure 1 la) and the \none determined with the finite element method (Figure 13b) shows a good agreement \nbetween the two methods.

Hence, the geotechnical parameters correspond to the sedi- \nments, which have not failed. In addition, the bathymetry presented in Figure 1 is a \ncompilation of prefailure data for depths ranging from 0 to 150 m and postfailure \ndata for the deeper part. \nGiven the lack of relevant prefailure bathymetry data and geotechnical \ncharacteristics, it is impossible to identify the origin of the Nice slope failure of \n1979. Therefore, the results obtained from the following safety factors calculations \nare subject to much reservation and cannot be considered to explain the origin of \nthe Nice slope failure. However, a low local safety factor can be very helpful in \nunderstanding the various factors that affect the stability, and it can be used as an \nindicator for the high-risk zones. The geotechnical parameters identified from experi- \nmental tests on 19 cores were interpolated over the whole Nice slope area (- 30 km2). \nGeotechnical parameters are affected to the grid nodes according to the classification \ncarried out by Cochonat et al.

The calculation was carried out for a critical depth z, of 3 m \nfor the whole area. We considered the geographical distribution of the undrained \nshear strength profiles shown in Figure 2. \nFigure 17 displays the safety factors in the zone defined in Figure 3.

The \nsubdivision of the zone into three sectors corresponding to the underconsolidated \nsediment, normally consolidated, and overconsolidated has a secondary effect. The \nsafety factor presented in Figure 17 corresponds to a critical depth (z,) of 3 m. The \nfailure condition is reached (FOS < 1) in a local section of the underconsolidated \nsediment Figure 17. \nDespite the simplicity and the rapidity of Mulder’s method to determine \nthe safety factor map for a considered area, attention should be paid to some \nquestionable points:",

One of those scenarios was developed by \nSeed (according to Habib. 1994). He supposed that the disturbance originated \nfar from the coast (around 15 kin) and resulted from the collapse of a hundred million \ncubic meters of sediments. This offshore landslide rvould have been the cause of tlie \nprogressive wave that reached the coast almost simultaneously, inducing a lowering of \nabout 2.5 in of the sea level. The embankment of the airport extension was no longer \nsubmerged. which created a sudden load increase on the soil. Seed supposed that the \nlowering of the water level was enough to initiate the embankment failure. \nOur model was applied to Seed's scenario in order to study the effect of the \nlowering o f  the 2.5 m of the sea level on the stability of the Nice slope. The sea level \nwas considered at -2.5 ni. For the sediment above -2.5 m. no buoyancy effect was \nconsidered in the safety factor calculation. As in the first scenario. the calculation \nw;is carried out under gravitational loading and for undrained condition along 2209 \ncross sections. All tlie calculation steps were performed and the safety factor was \ndetermined at each node. The safety factor map of the Nice slope is presented in \nFigure 20. One can observe a decrease of the safety factor in the area surrounding the \nnew Nice airport with respect to the classical gravitational loading calculation. \nH~wever. the sal'ety Factors remained greater than one in the area indicated by a \nframe i n  Figure 20 (Figure 21 b). As in the case of the infinite slope stability. the \nfailure condition was reached (FOS < 1) in a local section of the underconsolidated \nscdimcnt (Figure 20 mid Figure 21 a).",

The variation of the geotechnical \nparameters in the three directions of space was taken into account. For a given pore \npressure boundary condition, the effect of the water flow on the submarine slope \nstability can be considered. \nSince results from literature have shown that the safety factor calculated over an \narbitrary slip surface does not involve large errors (less than 5 YO), \nno restriction on \nthe postulated shape of the failure surface was considered. The safety factor was \nconsidered as a spatially varying quantity and the General Formulation (GLE, \nFredlund and Krahn, 1977), which fully satisfies equilibrium conditions, was used \nfor evaluating the stability of the marine slope. A two-dimensional calculation was \nperformed on a large number of vertical sections crossing the area and was extended \nto the three-dimensional zone. Determination of the shape and the volume of the \npotential failure surface was necessary to ensure that an appropriate initial condition \nfor the problem of the postfailure mechanism (sediment flows and turbidity currents) \nis defined.",
