        "text": "Many deltas exhibit gravitational deformation of their sedimentary cover. In these systems, the décollement\nlayers do not always consist of rock salt but sometimes of overpressured shale. Unlike salt, the efﬁciency of\ndetachment in shale depends on the magnitude of ﬂuid overpressures and it varies through time and space,\nas rapid sedimentary burial progrades into deeper water. As a result, the gravity deformational domains are\nprogressively translated seaward. Sandbox models involving high air pore pressures were used to simulate\nsuch gravity-driven shale tectonics in prograding deltas. Models were built with sand of various\npermeabilities and air was injected to simulate the mechanical effects of ﬂuid overpressure. Our apparatus\nfor the injection of air allowed us to control subsurface pressures in space and time during the experiments,\nand it was used to simulate the advance of the front of the overpressured domain during the sedimentary\nprogradation. In our models, sand kept obeying a frictional behavior, for medium to high pore pressures, and\nthe detachment appeared as very thin shear bands. Compressional belts that formed during the experiment\nwere dominated by asymmetric basinward-verging fore-thrusts, as is often observed in deep-water, shale-\ndetached foldbelts. Where the value of ﬂuid pressures approached that of the lithostatic stress, sand was\nﬂuidized, resulting in ductile strains analogous to what occurs in highly overpressured mobile shale. During\nprogradation, ancient buried thrustbelts were reactivated, thereby controlling later extension. During the\nexperiments, sand volcanoes, analogous to mud volcanoes, formed in relation with tectonic structures. Some\nof them developed near normal faults but many of them formed directly above old buried thrusts.\n© 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Salt is often considered as a viscous material having a very\nlow strength. Consequently, it starts to deform very soon after its\ndeposition. It leads to symmetric detachment folds, shortened salt\ndiapirs and/or inﬂated and thickened salt massifs and nappes (Rowan\net al., 2004; Fort and Brun, 2005). In the case of shale, contractional\nthrust and fold belts are dominated by asymmetric, basinward-\nverging thrust imbricates and multiple detachment levels (Briggs\net al., 2006). The main difference between salt and shale comes from\ntheir rheology. Salt rheology does not change with temperature, depth\nof burial or strain. Its rheological behavior does not vary much through\ntime and space. On the contrary, shale is a plastic material and its\nstrength greatly depends on the magnitude of the pore ﬂuid\noverpressure. If shale is highly overpressured and undercompacted,\nit becomes mobile and deforms under low stresses, rising by\nhydrofracturing the overburden and producing diapirs and mud\nvolcanoes (Morley and Guerin, 1996; VanRensbergen and Morley,\n2000; VanRensbergen and Morley, 2003; Deville et al., 2006).

Fluid overpressures\nmay result from a reduction in the pore space, caused by diagenesis or\ncompaction during burial or horizontal compression of tectonic origin.\nThey also result from an increase in the volume of pore ﬂuid resulting\nfrom thermal dilation, mineralogical transformation (smectite to\nillite) and hydrocarbon generation (for example, production of\nthermogenic gas at depths of over 5 km) (Barker, 1990; Cobbold\net al., 2004). As soon as the generating mechanism stops, abnormal\npressures tend to dissipate because the rocks are permeable (Neuzil,\n1986). As a result, overpressures occur at depth; they are likely to be\ntransitory and they may vary in space and time.\nAt basin scale, the front of the overpressured domain may advance\nbasinward as sediments prograde seaward. As a result, the gravity\ndeformational domains progressively migrate into deeper water (Fig.1).\nThe basinward limit of this deformation may not only be controlled by\nthe sedimentary wedge (McClay et al., 1998; Vendeville, 2005) but also\nby the boundary between overpressured and normally pressured shale,\nbecause of the increasing resistance to sliding.\nFor the last two decades, salt and shale tectonics have been\ninvariably studied with sandbox modeling by using silicone putty as a\ndécollement layer (Cobbold and Szatmari, 1991; Vendeville and\nJackson, 1992; Koyi, 1996; Ge et al., 1997a,b; McClay et al., 1998;\nGaullier et al., 2000; Brun and Fort, 2004; Fort et al., 2004; Gaullier\nand Vendeville, 2005; Vendeville, 2005). Such viscous analogue\nmaterial is probably well suited for salt whose rheology remains\nconstant through time, but it appears inadequate to simulate the\ndeformations of shale that is highly space and time-dependent.\nFor several years, a new analogue technique involving pore ﬂuid\nhas begun to prove itself. This new technique consists of injecting\ncompressed air in sandbox models to reduce effective strength of\nmaterials and produce efﬁcient detachments. The ﬁrst tests were\ncarried out by Cobbold and Castro (1999) and Cobbold et al. (2001)\nperformed the ﬁrst compressional experiments. Mourgues and\nCobbold (2003) have also used such models for demonstrating the\nsigniﬁcance of seepage forces in tectonics. More recently, the\ntechnique was improved by Cobbold et al. (2004), Mourgues and\nCobbold (2006a,b) and was successfully applied to verify some of the\ntheoretical predictions for thrust wedges containing ﬂuid over-\npressures (Cobbold et al., 2009) and for gravitational spreading and\ngliding above overpressured décollements.

The delta is located in the Gulf of Guinea (central West\nAfrica) and it is one of the largest modern delta-systems in the world\n(Weber and Daukoru, 1975; Cohen and McClay, 1996; Hooper et al.,\n2002; Briggs et al., 2006). It sits at the southern end of the Benue\ntrough formed during the Cretaceous opening of the South Atlantic.\nDuring Cretaceous, the Benue trough progressively ﬁlled with Albian\nand younger post-rift deposits and by the late Eocene, a delta began to\nprograde over the continental margin (Doust and Omatsola,1989) The\ndelta now consists of a broadly arcuate sedimentary prism some\n12 km thick and covering 140,000 km2 (Hooper et al., 2002). At the\nbase of the Tertiary section of the Niger Delta is the Akata Formation\nwhich is of marine origin. It is composed of thick shale sequences that\nare believed to contain source rocks, ranging in thickness from 2000 m\nat the distal part of the delta to 7000 m beneath the continental shelf.\nThis unit exhibits anomalously low P-wave seismic velocities that may\nreﬂect regional ﬂuid overpressures (Corredor et al., 2005) and it\nprovides a good detachment horizon for large gravity tectonics.\nThe Niger Delta is divided in two main lobes separated by the\nCharcot Fracture Zone, a prominent ridge of oceanic basement.\nDeformation in the delta has resulted from gravitational thin-skinned\ninstabilities that formed various structural zones (Fig. 2a,e) (Damuth,\n1994; Corredor et al., 2005). An extensional province, on land and in\nshallow water, is characterized by both basinward dipping and\ncounter-regional listric normal growth faults. Basinward of the\nextension zone is a diapir zone that exhibits passive, active and\nreactive mud diapirs that form mud volcanoes at the seaﬂoor (Graue,",

Each tube can provide a different\nﬂuid pressure. These tubes are linked by rubber-tubes to a series of 600\ninjectors that rest above a reservoir of compressed air. Each injector is\nﬁlled with a different thickness of sand to regulate the ﬂuid ﬂow and to\ncontrol the ﬂuid pressure (Mourgues and Cobbold, 2006a). During an\nexperiment, the reservoir and the injectors can be disconnected from\nthe upper table and removed. This allows us to change the thickness of\nsand in the injectors and thus to modify the distribution of pressure in\nthe model (Fig. 3). At the end of an experiment, models can be wetted\nand cut without any percolation of water into the sand in the injectors.\nWithin the models, the ﬂuid pressure distribution depends on the\npressure in the reservoir, the thickness of sand in each injector but also\non the permeability and the 3D shape of the sand model. To calculate\nthe thickness of sand for any desired distribution of ﬂuid pressure in\nthe model, we developed a 3D numerical application (Fig. 4).

The analytical model is drawn in Fig. 5a and analytical\ndevelopments are summarized in Appendix A. The ﬂuid pressure\nrequired to trigger a slope instability depends on (1) the length of the\nsliding sheet, (2) the dip of the detachment, (3) the slope of the\nwedge, and (4) the cohesion of the material used as a décollement\nlayer. Analytical solutions are calculated for models made of sand with\na 1 cm thick toe.

Although, the progradation front in natural\ndeltas is commonly lobate, we used linear fronts in our models.\nDeformation was thus assumed to be only 2D. Between two successive\nphases of progradation, gravitational collapse was triggered by in-\ncreasing the ﬂuid pressure in deﬁned parts of the models (Fig. 6b,c),\nassuming that ﬂuid overpressures develop principally in high\nsedimentation rate areas. During an experiment, the shape of the\ninjection window and the amount of ﬂuid overpressure evolved in\nspace and time as a consequence of the progradation (Fig. 6d1,d2). In\nsuch analogue experiments, there is no time scale because viscous\nsilicon putty is not used and because transitory ﬂuid pressures are not\nscaled. As a consequence, experiments are not continuous in time.\nGravity deformations are triggered by slowly increasing the air\npressure in the area where ﬂuid overpressure is assumed to develop.\nWhen the required ﬂuid pressure is reached, a part of the model\nsuddenly slides. Extensional faults develop at the upper part and\nthrusts form at the lower edge of the injection window. During\ndeformation, extensional grabens that formed on the wedge top were\nsequentially ﬁlled in order to simulate synkinematic sedimentation\nand in order to compensate for thinning of overburden and to avoid\nexplosions (Fig. 6c). On increasing the air pressure once more, the\nslide advances another step. This procedure is repeated several times\nuntil the increasing resistance at the toe prevents any new slide. At\nthis stage, the experiment is temporarily stopped, ﬂuid overpressure is\nset to zero and a new sand wedge is built to simulate sedimentary\nprogradation. A new injection window is then deﬁned according to\nthe new shape of the model and ﬂuid pressure is increased again to\ntrigger new gravity deformations.\nIn all the experiments, the distribution of pore pressure in the\ninjection window was deﬁned to provide a uniform parameter λ (ratio\nbetween pore pressure and lithostatic stress) at the base of the ﬁne\nsand (Fig. 4c). Outside the injection window, pore pressure was\nmaintained at the atmospheric pressure, which is equivalent to a\nhydrostatic state under water. We conducted three different",

After each sedimentary progradation, we increased\nthe length of the overpressured area according to the new shape of\nthe delta front and we kept constant the ﬂuid pressure at the back\nof the model (Fig. 6d1). At the beginning of the experiment, the\ninjection window was 70 cm long. Its lower edge was 10 cm beyond\nthe talus. Four slides were triggered and three progradations, each\n20 cm towards the basin, were done. Fig. 7b shows some photographs\nof the upper surface, and their structural interpretations. For each\ngravitational instability, an extensional domain appeared at the upper\nedge of the overpressured area and fore-thrusts developed at its lower\nedge. During the experiment, the extensional domain remained at the\nsame place but the compressional domain migrated basinward in\nresponse to the increasing length of the overpressured area. After each\nprogradation, new fore-thrusts appeared and only one buried thrust\nwas reactivated (Fig. 7b-2). Several sand volcanoes developed that\nwere linked to normal faults (Fig. 7a) and thrust faults (Fig. 7b,c).\nSome of them appeared in the extensional grabens because of a\ndecrease of the lithostatic stress, but most of them developed straight\nabove old buried thrusts (Fig. 7b). To avoid devastating explosions,\neach pockmark was covered by a ﬁne layer of sand in order to stop its\nactivity. However, some of the volcanoes remained active and\neffusions of ﬂuidized ﬁne sand continued. In such a case, the injector\njust behind the volcano was unplugged in order to locally decrease the\nﬂuid pressure. After four successive stages of progradation and\ngravitational instability, the experiment was stopped because it\nseemed to be impossible to produce any new instability without\ntriggering explosions.\nIn cross-section (Fig. 7a), three structural domains are distinct. The\nextensional part is 30 cm large. Extension is principally accommo-\ndated by basinward-verging normal faults and only two or three\nconjugated faults developed. The youngest normal faults are localized\njust beyond a zone where ﬁne sand has disappeared due to extension.\nThis part of the model remained stable during the last episode of\ngliding because the ﬁne sand was absent. In the transitional part, the\nmodel is slightly deformed. On the right of Fig. 7c, the thickness of the\nﬁne sand remains uniform but the layer progressively thickens on the\nleft to form a large and ﬂat dome. The upper cover draws a large fold.\nSix fore-thrusts developed in sequence forming the compressional\npart. In the central part of the compressional domain, fore-thrusts root\non a strongly thickened ﬁne sand layer. From this thick mass of ﬁne\nsand, two small pipes reach the surface (Fig. 7d). This proves that the\nﬂuid pressure was higher than the lithostatic pressure and that the\nﬁne sand was ﬂuidized.",

        "text": "Contrary to sand/silicone models, the mechanical behavior of the\nsand in our experiments evolves in space and time as a function of\npore ﬂuid pressure. In Experiment 1, two fundamentally different\nbehaviors are distinguishable. In the translational domain (Fig. 7a),\ndetachment probably took place in the ﬁne sand layer. However, no\ndeformation of the markers is visible. Gravitational gliding of the\nupper part certainly occurred on a very thin shear band parallel to the\nstratiﬁcation (Mourgues and Cobbold, 2006a). In the left part of the\ntranslational domain, the ﬁne sand layer locally thickens and forms a\nlarge and ﬂat dome. The upper cover draws a large fold (Fig. 7c). In the\nﬁne sand, we observe that the black markers were sheared by very\nﬁne shear zones which do not propagate in the upper coarse sand. This\nstructure could result from a variation of the depth of the main shear\ndetachment due to a diffuse deformation at high ﬂuid pressure\n(Mourgues and Cobbold, 2006b) and it could be interpreted as a broad\ndetachment fold. Such structures are common in shale-detached fold\nbelts of Niger Delta (Fig. 2c). In the compressional part of model 1, ﬁne\nsand was ﬂuidized during deformation (Fig. 7d). Black markers\ndisappeared and the ﬁne sand layer thickened a lot at the base of the\nthrusts. This thickening probably results from a ductile ﬂow of the\nﬂuidized sand towards the basin. Such viscous ﬂow happens in\ngravitational deformations triggered by ductile material such as salt.\nThis ﬂuidization proves that ﬂuid pressure locally reached the\nlithostatic stress. As a result, two sand volcanoes developed and\nexpelled ﬂuidized ﬁne sand. Two pipes ﬁlled with ﬁne sand are then\ndistinguishable in Fig. 7d. These kinds of intrusions of overpressured\nmaterial are current in basins where shale is overpressured (Van-\nRensbergen et al., 1999; Graue, 2000; Deville et al., 2006). Another",

Thus, an increasing size of the overpressured\narea under the margin (Experiment 1) is certainly a more realistic\nboundary condition than a displacement of the overpressure (Experi-\nments 2 and 3). In such conditions, the displacement of the exten-\nsional part may only result from a basinward movement of the\nsedimentary slope above a quasi-horizontal décollement layer (McClay\net al., 1998; Vendeville, 2005). To obtain such more realistic\ndeformations in overpressured sandbox models, the frictional mate-\nrial used for the décollement must have a lower strength than sand.\nIn Experiments 2 and 3, a second region of extension super-\nimposed on older buried paleo-thrusts. This phenomenon results from\nthe progradation of the shelf. Such analogous structures were\nmodeled by McClay et al. (1998, 2003) and are recognized in the\nNiger Delta (Fig. 2d). This location of extension indicates that the\ndetachment was locally more efﬁcient, an observation that is\nconﬁrmed by the formation of several antithetic normal faults\n(Mourgues and Cobbold, 2006a,b). Fig. 10 shows the results of a\nnumerical calculation of ﬂuid pressure around a buried thrust in an\nexperiment. We observe that ﬂuid overpressure slightly decreases just\nabove the thrust, but it increases just under it. Mourgues and Cobbold\n(2006b) have shown that a higher contrast of ﬂuid pressure between\nthe décollement layer and the upper sediments favors efﬁciency of the\ndetachment.\nContrary to what was expected, the fore-thrusts were not\nreactivated by normal faults (Faccenna et al., 1995), instead, they\nwere cut by normal faults. It probably comes from an unfavorable\norientation of the principal stress due to ﬂuid overpressures.",

        "text": "The structural style of fold belts developed above salt décollement\ndepends on the thickness of the viscous layer. Above thick salt,\nsymmetrical detachment folds and shortened diapirs develop (Rowan\net al., 2004; Fort and Brun, 2005). Inﬂated and thickened salt massifs\nand nappes are also common. If salt is thin, it has insufﬁcient volume\nto ﬁll the cores of detachment folds and the shortening is\naccommodated by reverse faults. The faults typically are vergent in\nboth directions but may have an asymmetric vergence. Nevertheless,\nRowan et al. (2004) underlined that gravity-driven thrust belts above\nthin salt are rare because early loading and deformation generally\nresult in distal salt inﬂation. Many deep-water fold and thrust belts\ndetached above overpressured shale are characterized by basinward-\nverging faults that imbricate above one or more detachments (Fig. 2a,\nb,c). This asymmetry typiﬁes frictional detachments. Such asymmetric\nbasinward-verging thrusts are well reproduced in our model 2. Some\nother shale-detached fold belts are characterized by symmetrical\ndetachment folds (Mexican Ridges) whose cores are ﬁlled with highly\noverpressured mobile shale. In model 1, the ﬁne sand also thickened\nsigniﬁcantly in the compressional part. This probably resulted from a\nductile ﬂow of the ﬂuidized sand towards the basin. Nevertheless, the\nthrusts are all basinward-verging and no antithetic fault appeared. It\nmay indicate that ﬂuidization and ductile thickening occurred after\nthe formation of the thrusts. In the Mexican ridges, the asymmetry has\nalso been interpreted as an early start of deformation while the shale\nwas still relatively strong (Rowan et al., 2004). Multiple detachment\nlevels are also common in shale-detached thrust belts of the Niger\nDelta (Corredor et al., 2005; Briggs et al., 2006). In model 3, two layers\nof ﬁne sand controlled the deformation and the structural style of the\ncontractional belt. Two detachments formed, but the upper décolle-\nment was less efﬁcient and it was active only in the compressional\npart. In this domain, it seems to locally control the formation of back-\nthrusts. Some ramps between the two detachments are also observed.\nThe vertical ﬂuid pressure proﬁle in the model is in Fig. 9d. Because air\nis injected at the base of the model, the ﬂuid pressure (λ) is maximum\nat the base of the ﬁne sand. As a consequence, most of the faults root\non the basal detachment. Moreover, according to the ﬂuid proﬁle in\nFig. 9d, the layer with low strength is probably thicker in model 3 than\nin models 1 and 2. Consequently, it was probably easier to contract the\nsand cover in model 3 and trigger a slope instability. It could also\nexplain the formation of pop-ups that requires very small strength of\nthe décollement.",

Our models have some advantages in comparison\nwith models involving silicone putty as décollement. Deformation of\noverpressured sand depends on the magnitude of the ﬂuid over-\npressure and, thus, it approaches the behavior of overpressured shale.\nFor moderate to high pressures, sand has a frictional behavior.\nDetachments looked like very ﬁne shear bands and compressional\nbelts are dominated by asymmetric basinward-verging thrusts as it is\noften observed in shale-detached fold belts. For ﬂuid overpressures\napproaching lithostatic stress, sand is ﬂuidized and behaves like a ﬂuid.\nIt results in local thickening of the décollement due to ductile ﬂow of\nthe ﬂuidized ﬁne sand. These deformations are analogous to what\nhappens in highly overpressured mobile shale. Sand volcanoes which\nare analogous to mud volcanoes also formed in our models. They\nexpelled ﬂuidized ﬁne sand. Moreover, our technique allows us to\ncontrol ﬂuid pressure in space and time so it is possible to test the\nstructural consequences of various ﬂuid pressure distributions and\nevolutions. Such a method may be suitable for “scenario” modeling.\nNevertheless, our method has some limits. It seems difﬁcult to\nsimulate slope instabilities on a very gentle slope (b2°) without\ntriggering sand volcanoes and devastating explosions. Less frictional\nmaterial will have to be tested. Moreover, ﬂuid pressure and\ndeformations are not fully coupled and it may be an important\nphenomenon during thrusting. By increasing viscosity of the pore ﬂuid\nand by decreasing the permeability of the granular material, it would\nbe possible to approach such coupling for more realistic modeling.",
