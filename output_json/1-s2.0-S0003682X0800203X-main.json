TexAn, originally developed for the textural analysis of sidescan sonar\nimagery, was tested over an area of \u000272 km2 surveyed in 2005 by the European MESH project. The mul-\ntibeam imagery is affected by several artefacts, including strong uncorrected angular variations in some\ntracks, and the acquisition of some tracks with very different aspects. The results from unsupervised clas-\nsiﬁcation of the imagery, using K-Means, match well the interpretations that can be made using concur-\nrent bathymetric data and visual observations acquired in a later cruise. Textural analyses successfully\ndetect faint trawlmarks and distinguish between the different types of seaﬂoor, including variations\nwithin sediments, rocky outcrops and gullied terrains.\n\u0002 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

It has now become a full-blown\nﬁeld of study, with many successful applications throughout the\nworld (e.g. [2–5]). Habitat mapping aims at integrating biological\nand geological studies with sonar imaging of the seabed and\noverlying features. Although each mapping system has its own\nadvantages and limitations (e.g. coverage vs. resolution), multi-\nbeam sounders have proved the most versatile and complete\ninstrument,\nproviding\nbackground\ntopography\nand\nshowing\nseabed features in relatively high detail (e.g. [6]). For most modern\nsurveys, repeatability and time evolution have become key factors\n(e.g. [7]). Owing to the amount of data collected in a typical survey,\nand the subtle variations in acoustic responses of some seabed\nfeatures, visual interpretation of sonar records is no longer an\noption. Acoustic classiﬁcation systems must provide quantitative\ndata in a reasonable time, and supplement the interpreter with\nas much information as possible.\nThere are many approaches to acoustic seabed classiﬁcation,\nand end-users from different ﬁelds aim for different objectives.\nTo conciliate the different aims, a workshop was organised in\n2006 to bring together both providers of acoustic classiﬁcation",

This workshop was held at the University of Ulster,\nColeraine, Northern Ireland, within the framework of the Interreg\nIIIB project MESH (‘‘Mapping European Seabed Habitats”) [9]. A\ncommon dataset of multibeam bathymetry and imagery was\nissued to all participants before the meeting, for treatment with\ndifferent approaches. These included reprocessing of the raw\nacoustic measurements as well as processing with acoustic\nclassiﬁcation systems, and the results are presented in companion\npapers in this issue. The present article focuses on the analysis of\nthe multibeam imagery with TexAn, a proprietary software from\nthe University of Bath originally designed for textural analyses of\nsidescan sonar imagery [10,11]. Section 2 describes the general\nmethod used to analyse acoustic textures of sonar images with\nTexAn. Section 3 shows its application to the multibeam imagery\nfrom the common MESH dataset. Section 4 discusses the results,\ncomparing them with those from other studies and with available\nground-truth. It also makes recommendations for improving the\nprocessing of the input multibeam imagery. Finally, Section 5 pro-\nvides a synthesis and guidelines for further uses of the textural\nanalyses of multibeam imagery.",

        "text": "images, whether acquired with a sidescan or a multibeam, tonal\ninformation is directly related to the amount of acoustic energy\nbackscattered, generally represented as grey levels. Different sta-\ntistical indices (e.g. extrema and median values) can be used to\nquantify local information. These ﬁrst-order statistics quantify\nthe distribution of the grey levels, but do not take into account\ntheir positions relative to each other (i.e. the acoustic textures).\nThese textures, however, account for most of the information in\nacoustic images, as countless studies have shown (e.g. [7,10–21]).\nThe local textural properties can be summarised as rough or\nsmooth, varied or homogeneous, repetitive or random, and hence\ncan help in distinguishing between different areas and features\nin the images. Quantitative textural measurements (second-order\nstatistics) can be extracted from the image with various tech-\nniques, the most efﬁcient being stochastic [12]. This original theo-\nretical work was supplemented with practical applications to sonar\nimagery by [10,13–16] and others, showing that Grey-Level Co-\noccurrence Matrices (GLCMs) are optimally adapted. GLCMs ad-\ndress the average spatial relationships between pixels of a small\nregion. Experiments on human vision (Julesz, 1973, in [10]) dem-\nonstrated that the eye could not distinguish between textures with\ndifferent second-order statistics, proving GLCMs could be used to\ngo further than traditional, visual interpretation alone.\nThe University of Bath software TexAn uses the indices derived\nfrom GLCMs calculated for each pixel in the images and clusters\nrelevant textural indices into appropriate groups, related to spe-\nciﬁc acoustic processes and structures on/in the seabed. This soft-\nware has been validated on sidescan sonar imagery in a variety of\nenvironments (e.g. [10,11,15,17,18]), and recent developments\n[19,20] showed its promise with multibeam sonar imagery.\nTo quantify the textures, TexAn calculates GLCMs {PD(i,j)} over\nthe entire image, within moving windows of a set size. Each ele-\nment PD(i,j) expresses the relative frequency of occurrence, within\nthe window, of two pixels with the respective grey levels i and j at\nD(SZ,h) (Euclidian distance SZ and angle h) from one another. If the\nimage is quantiﬁed with NG grey levels, the GLCMs will be\nNG \u0003 NG arrays. The distance D(SZ,h) is very sensitive to the orien-\ntation h. This is particularly true for sonar images, in which the\ninsoniﬁcation angle can vary both along and across track. In order\nto avoid changes in the textural indices of a feature with non-iso-\ntropic texture, insoniﬁed at different angles, the GLCMs are calcu-\nlated for the angles h = 0\u0003, 45\u0003, 90\u0003 and 135\u0003 and then averaged,\nfollowing Refs. [13] and [10]. Hence the only remaining computa-\ntional parameters are the inter-pixel displacement SZ, the number\nof grey levels (NG) and the size of the computational window (WS).\nThe matrices resulting from the calculations described above, how-\never, cannot be interpreted directly in an easy way (as can be seen\nfrom the examples in Fig. 1). Therefore, their information is sum-\nmarised in a set of statistical measures, called ‘indices’. More than\n25 different textural indices have been described in the literature\n(e.g. [10,13]), but a detailed evaluation of their performance has\nshown that the combination of two indices (entropy and homoge-\nneity) seems sufﬁcient to explain nearly all the textural variability\nin sidescan sonar images [10,14]. The entropy index measures the\nlack of spatial organisation within the computational window, and\nhence is a measure of the local amount of ‘chaos’. It will be higher\nfor rough textures, and lower for organised heterogeneities such as\nripples. Textural homogeneity is a measure of the amount of local\nsimilarities within the window. The index is similar to the ‘inverse-\ndifference moment’ of [15] and will increase in windows with less\ncontrast (fewer grey levels). An additional factor was introduced by\n[10] in the calculation of this index to ensure invariance during lin-\near grey-level transformations (such as those caused by variations\nin TVG or AVG from one computation window to another). Fig. 1\nshows how GLCMs can vary for even simple textures, and how\nentropy and homogeneity can clearly distinguish between even",

        "text": "This optimisation is performed by choosing Training Zones rep-\nresentative of the acoustic facies encountered in the entire image\nand which one wants to distinguish. These Training Zones need\nto be square (to avoid over-emphasis on one direction in the im-\nage). They need to be large enough to be statistically signiﬁcant\nfor a large range of window sizes, WS, as their size inﬂuences the\nnumber of times independent values can be measured. For exam-\nple, for a Training Zone of 100 \u0003 100 pixels, choosing WS = 90 pix-\nels can only yield 100 independent measurements of entropy and\nhomogeneity, whereas choosing WS = 10 pixels can yield 8100\nindependent measurements. Conversely, Training Zones need to\nbe small enough to encompass only one type of acoustic texture.\nThe ﬁrst parameter to vary is the size WS of the computation\nwindow. It can in theory take any value smaller than the size of\nthe Training Zones, but is in fact constrained by its physical signif-\nicance. Smaller values (10 pixels or smaller) will increase the con-\ntributions of very close pixels and measure the high-frequency\nbackscatter variations in the image (generally attributable to\nspeckle, particularly in multibeam imagery). Larger values (close\nto the size of the Training Zones) will instead look at lower-fre-\nquency variations in the image, and will have a higher probability\nof mixing two texturally distinct regions or missing intrinsic tex-\ntural characteristics. Finally, the difference in insoniﬁcation angles\nfrom one edge of the computation window to the opposite edge\nwill need to be taken into account, although it will be smaller for\nmultibeam systems than for sidescan sonars.\nThe second textural parameter is the displacement size SZ with-\nin the window. It is intricately linked to its size WS. Values close to\nWS will emphasize variations of the same size as the computation\nwindow, whereas the smaller values will emphasize the noise with-\nin the window. Again, the inﬂuence of the variations in ensoniﬁca-\ntion angle between pixels separated by SZ should be accounted for.\nIf small-scale variations in large structures are to be detected, a\nsmall SZ should be associated to a large WS. However, if the struc-\ntures to be observed are characterised by variations of a wavelength\ncomparable to their dimensions, SZ should be slightly less than the\nsize of the window. Based on practice with both sidescan and mul-\ntibeam imagery, the optimal values of SZ usually lie close to WS/2.\nLast but not least, the number of grey levels NG will affect both\nthe speed of the computation and its accuracy. As NG decreases,\nthere are less and less variations around the mean grey levels\n(smoothing of the dynamic range). For high values (as close to\nthe full dynamic range as possible), the textures are more likely\nto appear rougher and more heterogeneous. Systematic tests show\nthat, as NG decreases from 256 (8-bit dynamics) to 16 (4-bit\ndynamics), entropy will decrease linearly by 50% at most, and\nhomogeneity by 30%. The overall computation time varies approx-\nimately as o(NG2). For 8-bit dynamic ranges, practice shows that\noptimal numbers are usually between 32 and 128, depending on\nthe quality of the processing and the amount of noise in the image.\nThe combination(s)of optimal values are found by systematically\nvarying NG, WS and SZ and calculating entropy and homogeneity at\neach point in the Training Zones. The separation between Training\nZones is visualised in the feature space. It can be tested quantita-\ntively, but it is very sensitive to the overlap of poorly deﬁned (or\ncomplex) classes and a contextual assessment of the separation is\npreferred. For example, dunes will be seen either as ‘‘dunes” for large\nvalues of WS or as alternate ‘‘strips” for small values of WS. Similarly,",

Initial clustering in 14 classes [19] did not\nprove conclusive, as high levels of saturation in some areas and\nnear-nadir artefacts induced abusive grouping of some terrains. In-\nstead, 40 classes were initially created, in 98 iterations with a ﬁnal\nconvergence distance of 0.0. Some of them, corresponding to inter-\nmediate textures (i.e. boundaries and edges of image) were merged\nthrough contextual editing, and the ﬁnal result of 20 classes is pre-\nsented in Fig. 5. The entropy/homogeneity values of each cluster\ncentre are clearly distinct, and they are presented in Table 1 with\npreliminary analyses of the different types of textures.\nTexAn can clearly distinguish between the different terrains\npresent in the image. The feature-space plot (Fig. 5, bottom left)\nshows the colour scheme adopted for each entropy/homogeneity\ncluster. The grey classes comprise only 6.4% of the image, despite\ntheir high entropy/homogeneity spread. They are associated to\nthe edges of the multibeam image (as even pixels close to the edge\nwere analysed), areas with no data (gaps in the mosaic) and a cou-\nple of very small, completely saturated areas. Classes coloured in\ndark green (lowest entropies, lowest homogeneities) correspond\ngeographically to the outcrops, whose acoustic patterns show var-\niable contrasts (as seen in the ‘‘rock #2”Training Zone). Lighter\nshades of green (slightly higher entropies and signiﬁcantly higher\nhomogeneities) correspond to sediments of increasing textural\nroughness, generally placed on the slopes of the outcrops and be-\ntween the SE nadir lines. Increasing entropies and homogeneities\n(orange/brown/ochre tones) are associated to low-contrast bound-\naries between morphological regions. Classes coloured in purple to\nred tones relate to high-contrast boundaries and acoustically more\ncontrasted sediments, either because of their roughness or because\nthey are also affected by nadir artefacts. With lower entropies but\nsimilar homogeneities, yellow and dark yellow colours correspond\nto sediment inﬁll within the ravines, and sediment ponding within\nthe top of the different outcrops, generally in topographically\nrough terrain (hence with more variations in acoustic backscatter).\nWith the highest entropies and homogeneities, a clearly distinct\ntextural class, coloured in blue, is generally close texturally to\nthe ‘‘branch” Training Zone. It is interpreted as ravines and gullies.\nThe TexAn classiﬁcation shows a few artefacts: for example, the\nwide nadirs are not classiﬁed properly (as expected). Better pro-\ncessing of the original image, by removing the inﬂuence of nadirs,\nshould remedy to it.

As it was made available after processing only, the local-\nised ground-truth (see Fig. 2 of [8]) could not be used to deﬁne\nthe Training Zones. It was, however, used to reﬁne some of the\ninterpretations and compared well with what can be deduced from\nacoustic textures. As interpretation of sonar imagery is increasingly\ncarried out quantitatively with computers, the comparison with\nqualitative and visual interpretation is often used by non-special-\nists as a quick ‘‘measure” of how well a particular scheme works.\nHowever, the purpose of a real acoustic classiﬁcation system should\nnot be to emulate, in a visually pleasing manner, what a skilled\ninterpreter could achieve, but to reveal additional patterns leading\nto a deeper analysis of the sonar imagery. Because it quantiﬁes sec-\nond-order statistics, TexAn does reveal differences in acoustic tex-\ntures which can then be assigned to speciﬁc processes. Examples\nin this study included variations in sediments across the slopes of\nthe outcrops (light green shades in Fig. 5). As hinted by ground-tru-\nthing, these subtle textural variations seem related to increasing lo-\ncal slopes and micro-scale roughness (e.g. rougher sediments, then\nsmall gravel, then pebbles/cobbles, and then talus).\nMost uses of TexAn to date were with sidescan sonar imagery,\nand it is worth discussing the differences with multibeam sonar\nimagery and their potential impact on classiﬁcation results. Side-\nscan instruments image a wide swath of seabed, with pixels\nacross-track corresponding to slowly and continuously varying\nincidence angles [23]. These angles depend on the height of the so-\nnar and its tilt; because sidescan sonars are usually ﬂown close to\nthe seabed, these incidence angles will be low and nearly grazing.\nConversely, multibeam sonars are usually hull-mounted and hence\nhigher above the seabed. Incidence angles will be high and vary by\nsteps, because of beamforming at reception [24]. The way back-\nscatter is derived (e.g. from mean energy or from snippets) will",

These measurements can be merged into\nstatistically meaningful groups with K-means clustering in partic-\nular. TexAn has been applied to a multibeam dataset acquired dur-\ning the MESH project over Stanton Banks on the Irish continental\nshelf (Section 3). Optimisation of the processing parameters shows\nthat a reduced number of grey levels (64, in this case) is sufﬁcient,\nthat the size of the computation window is commensurate with\nthe scale of the structures visible on the image, and the inter-pixel\ndisplacement is close to WS/2, as seen in similar studies.

        "text": "cally important variations in acoustic patterns are not lost in com-\nparison with statistically more important background features.\nThey will also need to be implemented transparently, to ensure that\nthe physical meaning of these variations can still be assessed. First-\norder statistics can for example vary with the level of processing of\nthe multibeam imagery, and this needs to be accounted for. This ap-\nproach had shown promises in earlier work (Micallef and Blondel,\nunpublished,\n2006)\nusing\nsidescan\nimagery\nand\nmultibeam\nbathymetry. The exact and accurate co-registration of imagery\nand bathymetry offered by multibeam sonars, along with the cali-\nbration of the backscatter measurements, make this approach more\nattractive for multibeam-only datasets.\nThis study is one of the ﬁrst applications of TexAn analyses to\nmultibeam backscatter. It does not pretend to be perfect, and more\nwork needs to be done. Nonetheless, the results from unsupervised\nclassiﬁcation of entropy/homogeneity measurements using K-\nMeans match well concurrent bathymetric data and later visual\nobservations. Textural analyses successfully detect faint marks\nand distinguish the different types of seaﬂoor, including variations\nwithin sediments, rocky outcrops and gullied terrains. The success-\nful translation from sidescan to multibeam imagery is promising\nand opens new avenues for continental shelf mapping, and in par-\nticular habitat mapping.",
