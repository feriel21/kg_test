In this pa-\nper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong\nuse of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more\neﬃciently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture\ncontext and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localiza-\ntion. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very\nfew images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window\nconvolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neu-\nronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same net-\nwork trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast\nand DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these cate-\ngories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of\na 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full im-\nplementation (based on Caﬀe) and the trained networks are available at\nhttp://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.",

While convolutional networks\nhave already existed for a long time [8], their success was limited due to the\nsize of the available training sets and the size of the considered networks. The\nbreakthrough by Krizhevsky et al. [7] was due to supervised training of a large\nnetwork with 8 layers and millions of parameters on the ImageNet dataset with\n1 million training images. Since then, even larger and deeper networks have been\ntrained [12].\nThe typical use of convolutional networks is on classiﬁcation tasks, where\nthe output to an image is a single class label. However, in many visual tasks,\nespecially in biomedical image processing, the desired output should include\nlocalization, i.e., a class label is supposed to be assigned to each pixel. More-\nover, thousands of training images are usually beyond reach in biomedical tasks.\nHence, Ciresan et al. [2] trained a network in a sliding-window setup to predict\nthe class label of each pixel by providing a local region (patch) around that pixel",

The resulting\nnetwork won the EM segmentation challenge at ISBI 2012 by a large margin.\nObviously, the strategy in Ciresan et al. [2] has two drawbacks. First, it is quite\nslow because the network must be run separately for each patch, and there is a lot\nof redundancy due to overlapping patches. Secondly, there is a trade-oﬀbetween\nlocalization accuracy and the use of context. Larger patches require more max-\npooling layers that reduce the localization accuracy, while small patches allow\nthe network to see only little context. More recent approaches [11,4] proposed a\nclassiﬁer output that takes into account the features from multiple layers. Good\nlocalization and the use of context are possible at the same time.\nIn this paper, we build upon a more elegant architecture, the so-called “fully\nconvolutional network” [9]. We modify and extend this architecture such that it\nworks with very few training images and yields more precise segmentations; see\nFigure 1. The main idea in [9] is to supplement a usual contracting network by\nsuccessive layers, where pooling operators are replaced by upsampling operators.\nHence, these layers increase the resolution of the output. In order to localize, high\nresolution features from the contracting path are combined with the upsampled\noutput. A successive convolution layer can then learn to assemble a more precise\noutput based on this information.",

        "text": "One important modiﬁcation in our architecture is that in the upsampling\npart we have also a large number of feature channels, which allow the network\nto propagate context information to higher resolution layers. As a consequence,\nthe expansive path is more or less symmetric to the contracting path, and yields\na u-shaped architecture. The network does not have any fully connected layers\nand only uses the valid part of each convolution, i.e., the segmentation map only\ncontains the pixels, for which the full context is available in the input image.\nThis strategy allows the seamless segmentation of arbitrarily large images by an\noverlap-tile strategy (see Figure 2). To predict the pixels in the border region\nof the image, the missing context is extrapolated by mirroring the input image.\nThis tiling strategy is important to apply the network to large images, since\notherwise the resolution would be limited by the GPU memory.\nAs for our tasks there is very little training data available, we use excessive\ndata augmentation by applying elastic deformations to the available training im-\nages. This allows the network to learn invariance to such deformations, without\nthe need to see these transformations in the annotated image corpus. This is\nparticularly important in biomedical segmentation, since deformation used to\nbe the most common variation in tissue and realistic deformations can be simu-\nlated eﬃciently. The value of data augmentation for learning invariance has been\nshown in Dosovitskiy et al. [3] in the scope of unsupervised feature learning.\nAnother challenge in many cell segmentation tasks is the separation of touch-\ning objects of the same class; see Figure 3. To this end, we propose the use of\na weighted loss, where the separating background labels between touching cells\nobtain a large weight in the loss function.\nThe resulting network is applicable to various biomedical segmentation prob-\nlems. In this paper, we show results on the segmentation of neuronal structures\nin EM stacks (an ongoing competition started at ISBI 2012), where we out-\nperformed the network of Ciresan et al. [2]. Furthermore, we show results for\ncell segmentation in light microscopy images from the ISBI cell tracking chal-\nlenge 2015.

The data set is provided by the EM segmentation challenge [14,1] that was\nstarted at ISBI 2012 and is still open for new contributions. The training data\nis a set of 30 images (512x512 pixels) from serial section transmission electron\nmicroscopy of the Drosophila ﬁrst instar larva ventral nerve cord (VNC). Each\nimage comes with a corresponding fully annotated ground truth segmentation\nmap for cells (white) and membranes (black). The test set is publicly available,\nbut its segmentation maps are kept secret. An evaluation can be obtained by\nsending the predicted membrane probability map to the organizers. The evalu-\nation is done by thresholding the map at 10 diﬀerent levels and computation of\nthe “warping error”, the “Rand error” and the “pixel error” [14].",
