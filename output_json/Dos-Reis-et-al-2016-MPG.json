        "text": "Extra sets of 2D multi-channel seismic and chronostratigraphic data allowed us to undertake analyses of\nsource to sink processes and triggering mechanisms of the gigantic megaslides previously documented\noff the NW and SE steep slope settings of the Foz do Amazonas basin. As these megaslides comprise two\nsets of stacked allochthonous masses within the Upper Miocene-Quaternary sedimentary record, they\nare now described as Mass-Transport Complexes (MTCs) and have been renamed the Amap\u0001a Megaslide\nComplex (AMC) and the Par\u0001a-Maranh~ao Megaslide Complex (PMMC). Individual megaslides of both MTCs\ncan mobilize up to kilometre-thick sedimentary series as allochthonous masses with distinct ﬂow di-\nrections, degrees of sediment disruption and internal coherence. Megaslides spread downslope over\nareas as large as thousands of km2, attaining dimensions comparable to the world's largest mass-\ntransport deposits. Among all the megaslides, the basal and largest AM1 megaslide (AMC) stands as a\nquite unique example of mass-transport deposit in the basin, interpreted as a dominant carbonate\nallochthonous mass sourced from a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic platform. The instability was probably\ntriggered between the late Miocene and the end of the Early Pliocene by the gravitational collapse of the\nmixed platform under its own weight, after successive subaerial exposures which generated kar-\nstiﬁcation processes. Siliciclastic-type megaslides, on the other hand, are all sourced from large upslope\nslide and/or rotated blocks (up to 60 km wide in the case of the PMMC). The detachment of upslope\nblocks was triggered by structurally-induced seabed movements during the Mid Pliocene-Pleistocene (in\nthe case of the PMMC) and during the Pleistocene (in the case of the AMC). All mapped features support\nthe interpretation of sedimentary blocks which have undergone long lasting deformation, having been\nvariably folded and faulted by the sliding along an overpressured condensed section (H3 horizon). H3\nhorizon equally acts as the upper d\u0001ecollement level for the gravity tectonic system that operates on the\nregional scale of the Foz do Amazonas basin. In such a context, the results of this study evidence complex\nlinks between variable modes and scales of gravity processes (gravity tectonics and MTCs emplace-\nments), all induced by instability created from a condensed section prone to produce pore ﬂuid over-\npressure. And yet, seismic attributes of the d\u0001ecollement H3 across the slope, characterized by a reﬂector of\nnegative polarity of high amplitude, indicate that the potential for similar large scale sediment failures\ncontinues to exist across the AMC and PMMC.\n© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

        "text": "The Foz do Amazonas basin (Amazon Mouth basin) is the largest\noffshore basin located on the Brazilian Equatorial Atlantic margin.\nThis basin has been the target of systematic exploration by oil\ncompanies in recent decades, due to the potential occurrence of oil\nplays in the deep-water marine setting. The Amazon Deep-sea Fan\n(referred to hereinafter as the Amazon fan) stands as the main deep\nbasin sedimentary feature, built out as a prominent, thick sedi-\nmentary prism, of about 10 km in thickness according to Brand~ao\nand Feij\u0001o (1994) and Figueiredo et al. (2007). Mass-transport de-\nposits have also long been reported as important stratigraphic el-\nements in the margin sedimentary construction, especially in the\nUpper Quaternary Amazon fan (e.g., Damuth and Embley, 1981;\nDamuth et al., 1988; Flood et al., 1991; Piper et al., 1997; Maslin\net al., 2005).\nIn most studies of the upper 500e800 m layers of the Amazon\nfan the occurrence of mass wasting has been correlated either\nwith climate-induced processes, gas hydrate instability or sedi-\nment loading (e.g., Damuth and Embley, 1981; Damuth et al., 1988;\nFlood et al., 1991; Piper et al., 1997; Maslin and Mikkelsen, 1997;\nPirmez and Imran, 2003; Maslin et al., 2005). However, the Up-\nper Cretaceous to Quaternary stratigraphic section of the basin\nalso glides along multiple d\u0001ecollements in a linked extensional-\ncompressional system (Cobbold et al., 2004; Silva et al., 2009;\nReis et al., 2010). An upslope set of extensional faults and huge\ndownslope fold-and-thrust belts root into three main basal weak\nlevels. Thrust structures can reach the sea ﬂoor, forming scarps as\nhigh as 500 m (Reis et al., 2010). In such a deformational context,\nReis et al. (2010) showed that gravity tectonics has also acted as a\nsigniﬁcant preconditioning parameter for slope failures: a link has\nbeen established between compressional deformation of fold-and-\nthrust belts in the central Amazon fan and the onset of triggering\nconditions\nfor\nsediment\nsliding\nprocesses\nduring\nthe\nlate\nQuaternary.\nThe occurrence of megaslides has also been reported in Foz do\nAmazonas basin (Araújo et al., 2009; Silva et al., 2010), recorded as\ngigantic and multiple slide masses which, unlike the Upper Qua-\nternary MTDs previously mapped in the area (e.g., Damuth and\nEmbley, 1981; Damuth et al., 1988; Flood and Piper, 1997; Maslin\net al., 2005), occur only off the steep margin settings both to the\nNW and SE of the Amazon fan (Fig. 1). These megaslides, named\nthe Amap\u0001a Megaslide and the Par\u0001a-Maranh~ao Megaslide, occur as\nstacks of large-scale and thick mass-transport deposits (individual\nthicknesses of up to 1000 m). As the megaslides are located along\nportions of the steep continental slope of the basin, and under\nsedimentation rates considerably lower than those of the central\nbasin region of the Amazon fan, Silva et al. (2010) ascribed the\nmain inducing factor for these mega-events to high slope gradi-\nents. However, due to the limited database these allochthonous\nmasses were neither stratigraphically constrained nor have their\ninternal structures and features yet been analyzed in detail until\nnow. In this context, further details as to how these mega mass-\ntransport deposits occur and how they are stratigraphically orga-\nnized are not only necessary but also fundamental for exploration\npurposes.\nIn the present study, we have integrated additional 2D regional\nseismic lines and well data to supplement the database of Silva\net al. (2010), in order to clarify internal seismic facies, structures\nand the stratigraphy of the megaslides of both complexes. This\nprocedure now provides the most detailed correlation framework\nwith chronostratigraphic signiﬁcance for the Amap\u0001a and the Par\u0001a-\nMaranh~ao Megaslides. It has also allowed us to propose their\nsource\nto\nsink\nprocesses\nas\nwell\nas\ntheir\nmain\ntriggering\nmechanisms.",

        "text": "The Foz do Amazonas basin evolved within a context of both\nwrenching tectonics, kinematically related to ancient transform\nmovements especially along the Saint Paul Fracture Zone (e.g.,\nMatos, 2000; Moulin et al., 2010), and compressional tectonics,\nrelated to the history of the Andean uplift, which reshaped the\ncatchment basin of the Amazon river (e.g., Hoorn et al., 1995;\nLatrubesse et al., 2007; Figueiredo et al., 2009). In terms of crus-\ntal structures, the Cear\u0001a Rise stands as an outstanding aseismic\nridge in the western Equatorial Atlantic located approximately\n800 km east of the Amazon river mouth (Fig. 2). The top of this rise\nlies at about 3000 m below sea level, located just beyond the edge\nof the Amazon fan and surrounded by a seaﬂoor of an average\ndepth of about 4500 m. The Amazon fan deposits lap onto the base\nof the western side of the Cear\u0001a Rise at about 4200 m water depth\n(Curry et al., 1995; Dobson et al., 2001).\nThe base of the stratigraphic succession of the Foz do Amazonas\nbasin is composed of Neocomian to Albian ﬂuvio-deltaic, lacustrine\nand marine strata, inﬁlling pull-apart half-grabens (Brand~ao and\nFeij\u0001o, 1994; Figueiredo et al., 2007). Open marine clastic deposi-\ntion started during the Eo-Albian (c. 102 Ma) with the deposition of\ndeep-water mudstones and siltstones that lasted until the Neo-\nPaleocene (Limoeiro Formation; Fig. 3). The Cenozoic sedimentary\nhistory of the basin was dominated, from the late Paleocene to the\nlate Miocene (~61.7e~9.5 Ma), by carbonates which were periodi-\ncally disrupted by siliciclastic deposition (Wolff and Carozzi, 1984;\nGorini et al., 2014), resulting in the buildup of a mixed carbonate-\nsiliciclastic platform as thick as 4000 m (Maraj\u0001o and Amap\u0001a For-\nmations), laterally equivalent to deep-water calcilutites and mud-\nstones (Travosas Formation; Fig. 3).\nDuring the development of the mixed carbonate-siliciclastic\nplatform, the basin experienced a series of drowning phases\nintercalated with major regressive phases (Figueiredo et al., 2007).\nThe last and most important drowning phase occurred during the\nMiddle Miocene, reaching the maximum transgression during the\nLanghian (c. 15.2 Ma). Following this Middle Miocene maximum\nﬂooding, coastal depositional systems prograded (Maraj\u0001o Forma-\ntion; Fig. 3), while the carbonate platform continued to develop on\nthe external continental shelf. This drowning phase lasted until the\nlate Miocene when lower sea levels exposed, karstiﬁed and eroded\nthe carbonate platform culminating in the deﬁnitive cessation of\ncarbonate sedimentation at c. 9.5 Ma (Gorini et al., 2014). As\nrecently shown by Gorini et al. (2014), until the late Pliocene\nincreasing siliciclastic input into this basin occurred as dominantly\nprograding shelf clinoforms developed across the proximal basin,\nwhereas higher siliciclastic input into deep-water settings occurred\nduring the Quaternary.",

PM4 remobilized sediments thin\nsigniﬁcantly from about 1000 me100 m towards its outermost\neastern distal portion located in the Par\u0001a-Maranh~ao basin, given\nthat the landslide mass tends to migrate to higher stratigraphic\nhorizons (Figs. 14B and 15). Its maximum thickness (c. 700 m) is\nreached midway along its whole extension (Fig. 14). Upslope, PM4\nis dominated by chaotic to transparent facies indicating a high\ndegree of sediment disruption, seismically compatible with debris\nﬂows (Fig. 14A). Further downslope, however, it is composed of a\nlarge series of imbricate thrusts as wide as 50 km that in map view\nform crescent-shaped compressional structures which eventually\nreach the seaﬂoor to form a topographic high relief (up to 100 m\nhigh; Figs. 12B and 14B). These structures clearly indicate that this\nlandslide mass has undergone signiﬁcant frontal conﬁnement\n(Fig. 14). Similarly, near its eastern end in the Par\u0001a-Maranh~ao basin,\nPM4 exhibits pressure ridges (Figs. 12B and 15). On the other hand,\nsome distal portions although initially ramping up and exhibiting\nsome degree of buttressing, eventually spread over undeformed\nsea-ﬂoor units in an unconﬁned way (Fig. 15).\nPM4 is, throughout, overlain by a continuous layer of about\n150e200 m thick, characterized by in situ discontinuous plane-\nparallel reﬂectors, reﬂecting its original layering preserved on the\ntop of the MTD. This upper inﬁlling layer is nevertheless marked by\nsmall irregularities of the seaﬂoor and is eventually lifted by the\ndistal pressure ridge as well (Figs. 13 and 14).",

The two largest meg-\naslides of each complex alone (AM1 and PM4, respectively; Tables 1\nand 2) are comparable to the world's largest mass-wasting deposits\n(Fig. 17). Further, the two MTCs show that large MTDs have been\nrecurrent throughout the basin since at least the late Miocene, thus\nstanding out as essential architectural elements of the basin's\nstratigraphy (Figs. 16 and 18).\nAge correlations, together with the reﬁnement of the in-\nterpretations of the seismic facies and stratigraphic origins of each\ncomponent of the PMMC and the AMC, allowed us to evidence that\nthese MTCs comprise vertical stacks of huge megaslides (interlay-\nered with undisturbed turbidites or hemipelagites) which involve\nthe Upper Miocene-Quaternary sedimentary succession (Figs. 16\nand 18).

It is the oldest allochthonous mass and cor-\nresponds to a rather thick and extensive megaslide (Table 1 and\nFig. 8) whose deposition predates the higher siliciclastic input to\ndeep-water settings known to have occurred from the late\nPliocene-Quaternary onwards (Figueiredo et al., 2009; Gorini et al.,\n2014).\nAlthough identiﬁcation of its headscarp area is far less clear than\nthose of the AM2-AM6 set of megaslides, regional seismic and\nstratigraphic analyses support the interpretation that the basal\nAM1 was sourced from the collapse of the Upper Paleocene-Upper\nMiocene mixed carbonate-siliciclastic platform. This interpretation\nis based on the concave-shaped geometry of the shelf-edge of the\ncentral basin, made up of a series of backstepping features carved in\nthe steep margins of the mixed siliciclastic-carbonate, evidencing\nthat the platform has frequently failed (Fig. 20). Failure of this\nplatform produced rock slides like those represented by high\namplitude reﬂections, comparable to the conﬁguration of re-\nﬂections of the carbonate platform itself (Fig. 11B). Besides that, the\nhighly chaotic to transparent seismic facies that dominates AM1 for\nat least 300 km downslope evidences a rather mobile and erosive\nnature of the allochthonous mass, probable as a result of a pre-\nfailed weakening of the platform due to karstiﬁcation during suc-\ncessive periods of shelf exposure (see subsection 5.3.1. below). The\nNorth-Northwestern direction of ﬂow, in its turn, was most prob-\nably conditioned by the late Miocene paleo bathymetry which\ndescribes a regional morphological depression dipping north-\nwestwards (Fig. 20A).",

As a\nresult, PM4 is the largest megaslide in volume (Table 2),\nhaving been forced to change direction toward the Par\u0001a-\nMaranh~ao basin, due to a strong buttressing effect exerted by\nthe Cear\u0001a Rise, and probably also by the Amazon fan's thick\ndepositional ﬂank as well (Figs. 12 and 14).

Such as-\nsumptions are also supported by information provided by\nWolfﬁand Carozzi (1984), who, after analyzing core samples\nfrom 18 wells drilled throughout the Amap\u0001a Formation,\npointed out that the uppermost Early to Mid-Miocene\nsequence of the carbonate platform “shows the most\nintense generation of secondary porosity and of dolomiti-\nzation …” and that it “… is characterized by the widespread\noccurrence of vuggy to channel porosity”;\n(ii) as the global sea-level rose again between 11.8 Ma and 10.5\nMa (Haq et al., 1987), it is possible that the distal shelf may\nhave been drowned again and that the water column may\nhave overloaded an already fragile shelf. Then, at some point\nthe platform became weak enough to collapse under its own\nweight;\n(iii) but the shelf seems to have resisted during most of the 10.5\nMa sea level rise, since the condensed section depicted by\nhorizon H3 is at places strongly eroded by the AM1 down-\nslope ﬂow (Figs. 8 and 11). Such temporal correlations make\nit clear that the central-northwestern carbonate platform\ncollapsed only after the cessation of the carbonate sedi-\nmentation (~9.5 Ma).

Blocks deformation was triggered by ﬂuid\noverpressure along a regional Upper Miocene condensed\nsection,\nhorizon\nH3,\nwhich\nalso\nacts\nas\nthe\nregional\nd\u0001ecollement level for gravity tectonics in the basin;\n(d) ﬂuid overpressure conditions along H3 does not seem to\nhave been attained synchronously throughout the basin. In\nthe case of the PMMC sufﬁcient overpressure capable of\ntriggering sediment slide seems to have been attained from\nthe Early Pliocene onwards; in the case of the AMC over-\npressure conditions seems to have been attained later on,\nfrom the mid Pleistocene onwards;\n(e) the conditions for structurally-induced slope instability\ngenerated by the regional d\u0001ecollement level H3 are still pre-\nsent across the MTCs. The reﬂector of high amplitude nega-\ntive\npolarity\nthat\ncharacterizes\nH3\nindicates\nthat\nthe\npotential for similar large scale sediment failures continues\nto exist in the basin.",
