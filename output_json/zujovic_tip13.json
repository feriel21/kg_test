        "text": "that of existing metrics. For that we focus on a particular\nCBR application, which facilitates testing on a large texture\ndatabase, and allows the use of different metric performance\nstatistics, which emphasize different aspects of performance\nthat are relevant for many other image analysis applications.\nTraditional similarity metrics evaluate the similarity be-\ntween two images on a point-by-point basis. Such metrics\ninclude mean squared error (MSE) and peak signal-to-noise\nratio (PSNR), as well as metrics that make use of explicit\nlow-level models of human perception [1], [2]. The latter\nare typically implemented in the subband/wavelet domain\nand are aimed at the threshold of perception, whereby two\nimages, typically an original and a distorted image, are vi-\nsually indistinguishable. In contrast, our goal is to assess the\nsimilarity of two textures, which may have visible point-by-\npoint differences, even though neither one of them appears to\nbe distorted and both could be considered as original images.\nThe interest in metrics that deviate from point-by-point\nsimilarity was stimulated by the introduction of the structural\nsimilarity metrics (SSIM) [3], a class of metrics that attempt\nto incorporate “structural” information in image comparisons.\nSuch metrics have been developed in both the space domain\n(S-SSIM) [3] and the complex wavelet domain (CW-SSIM)\n[4], and make it possible to assign high similarity scores\nto pairs of images with signiﬁcant pixel-wise deviations that\ndo not affect the structure of the image. However, as we\ndiscuss below, SSIM metrics still rely on point-by-point cross-\ncorrelations between two images or their subbands, and thus\nretain enough point-by-point sensitivity that they will generally\nnot give high similarity values to textures that are structurally\nsimilar. In order to overcome such constraints, Zhao et al.\n[5] proposed a structural texture similarity metric, which\nwe will refer to as STSIM-1, that relies entirely on local\nimage statistics, and thus completely eliminates point-by-point\ncomparisons; while Zujovic et al. [6] included additional\nstatistics to obtain STSIM-2. The goal of this paper is to expand\non and systematically explore this idea. We present a general\nframework for STSIMs whose key elements are a multiscale\nfrequency decomposition, a set of subband statistics, formulas\nfor comparing statistics, and pooling to obtain an overall sim-\nilarity score. An additional goal is to test metric performance\non a large database of natural textures.\nWe develop a number of STSIMs that utilize both intra- and\ninter-subband correlations, and different ways of comparing\nstatistics. The development of texture similarity metrics has\nbeen motivated and guided by recent research in the area\nof texture analysis and synthesis. Our interest is in texture\nanalysis/synthesis techniques that rely on multiscale frequency",

The most impressive and complete\nresults were presented by Portilla and Simoncelli [11], who\ndeveloped a technique based on an elaborate statistical model\nfor texture images that is consistent with human perception. It\nis based on the steerable ﬁlter decomposition [12] and relies\non a model with several hundred parameters to capture a very\nwide class of textures. While in principle a direct comparison\nof the model parameters can form the basis for a texture sim-\nilarity metric, our goal is to show that a successful similarity\nmetric can be based on signiﬁcantly fewer parameters.\nA number of applications can make use of STSIMs, and\neach application imposes different requirements on metric\nperformance and testing procedures. For example, in image\ncompression it is important that the metric exhibit a monotonic\nrelationship between measured and perceived distortion, while\nin image retrieval applications it may be sufﬁcient for the\nmetric to distinguish between similar and dissimilar images\nwithout a need for precise ordering. The focus of this paper\nis on CBR, and in particular, on the recovery of textures\nthat are identical to a query texture, in the sense that they\ncould be patches from a large perceptually uniform texture,\nas shown in Figure 1. However, these metrics have also been\nused in image compression [13]. Note that the patches at the\nbottom of Fig. 1 have visible point-by-point differences, but\nto a human observer there is no doubt that they are the same\ntexture. The zebra example was chosen to emphasize the point;\ntypical textures are not as coarse as this. Retrieval of identical\ntextures is important in CBR when one may be seeking images\nthat contain a particular texture (material, fabric, pattern, etc.),\nas well as in some near-threshold coding applications. The\nproblem of searching for a known target image in a database\nhas been extensively studied by the text retrieval community\nand is referred to as known-item search [14]. It has also been\naddressed by the image processing community for texture\nretrieval applications [15]–[17].\nThe evaluation of image similarity metrics, in general,\nrequires extensive subjective tests, with several human sub-\njects and a large number of image pairs. It also requires\nappropriate statistical measures of performance. Depending\non the performance requirements, a number of traditional\nstatistical measures can be used. For example, Spearman’s",

In [5], the performance\ncriterion was whether a metric can distinguish between similar\nand dissimilar pairs, irrespective of the ordering within each\ngroup. This idea was further explored in [19], where we argued\nthat the combination of testing procedure and statistical per-\nformance measure is critical for obtaining meaningful results.\nThe advantage of evaluating metric performance in the\ncontext of retrieving identical textures is that the ground truth\nis known, and therefore no subjective tests are required. Of\ncourse, the ground truth is known to the extent that the texture\nfrom which the identical patches are obtained is perceptually\nuniform. Another advantage of evaluating a metric in this\ncontext is the availability of a number of well-established sta-\ntistical performance measures, which include precision at one\n(measures in how many cases the ﬁrst retrieved document is\nrelevant), mean reciprocal rank (measures how far away from\nthe ﬁrst retrieved document is the ﬁrst relevant one), mean\naverage precision, and receiver operating characteristics.\nIn evaluating the similarity of two textures, one has to\ntake into account both the color composition and the spatial\ntexture patterns. In [6] we proposed a new structural texture\nsimilarity metric that separates the computation of similarity\nin terms of grayscale texture and color composition, and then\ncombines them into a single metric. However, our subjective\ntests indicate that the two attributes are quite separate and\nthat there are considerable inconsistencies in the weights that\nhuman subjects give to the two components [6], [19]. Thus,\nfor the present study, we focus only on grayscale textures.\nWe present a general framework for STSIMs that includes the\nmetrics proposed in [5] and [6], as well as a new metric that\nrelies on the Mahalanobis distance between vectors of subband\nstatistics (STSIM-M).\nInitial experiments with STSIM-2 were performed on a\ndatabase of 748 natural textures [20]. In this paper, we present\nexperimental results with two databases with a total of 1363\ndistinct texture images, extracted from 486 larger texture\nimages. Our results indicate that the proposed metrics substan-\ntially outperform existing metrics in the retrieval of identical\ntextures, according to all of the standard statistical measures\nmentioned above, each of which emphasizes different aspects\nof metric performance.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews\ngrayscale texture similarity metrics, including SSIM metrics.\nThe proposed STSIM metrics are discussed in Section III.\nSection IV presents the experimental results.

So, we restrict our discussion – and this paper – to\nthe grayscale case.\nImage similarity metrics can be broadly grouped into two\ncategories: (1) image quality or ﬁdelity metrics that attempt to\nquantify the (ideally perceptual) difference between an original\nand a distorted image, and (2) image similarity metrics that\ncompare two images without any judgment about quality. The\nformer are aimed at image compression and the latter at CBR\napplications. The texture similarity metrics we propose in this\npaper fall somewhere between these two categories, and are\nintended for both applications, even though the focus of our\nexperimental results will be on their retrieval abilities. Note\nthat most of the metrics we discuss do not meet the formal\ndeﬁnition of a metric, but we will refer to them as metrics\nanyway.\nAnother broad categorization of grayscale texture similarity\nmetrics is into statistical and spectral metrics [22], [23].\nSpectral analysis (subband decomposition) is essential if a\nmetric is going to emulate human perception, while statistical\nanalysis is necessary for embodying the stochastic nature of\ntextures.

One of the best-known\nmethods is based on co-occurrence matrices [24]–[26], which\nrely on relationships between the gray values of adjacent\npixels, typically within a 2 × 2 neighborhood. However, given\nthe small size of the neighborhood, such methods are not well-\nsuited for computing similarity of textures other than the so-\ncalled microtextures [27].\nAnother approach is to rely on ﬁrst and second order statis-\ntics. Chen et al. [28] used the local correlation coefﬁcients\nfor texture segmentation applications. However, as Julesz et\nal. [29], [30] have shown, humans can easily discriminate\nsome textures that have the same second-order statistics. Thus,\nsimple second order statistics of image pixels are not adequate\nfor the evaluation of perceptual texture similarity.\nAnother class of statistical methods rely on Markov random\nﬁelds (MRF) to model the distribution of pixel values in a\ntexture [31], [32]. In combination with ﬁltering theory, the\nMRF models can also be used for texture synthesis [33]. The\nmain drawback of MRF-based approaches is that MRFs can\nonly model a subset of textures.\nOjala et al. [16] utilize local binary patterns (LBP) to\ncharacterize textures, mainly for retrieval applications. Their\nmethod constructs binary patterns that describe the relative\nvalue of a pixel to image values in circles of different radii.\nIt then constructs histograms of such patterns for each circle,\non the basis of which it computes a log-likelihood statistic\nthat two images come from the same class. This method is\nvery simple yet effective for the task of texture classiﬁcation.\nHowever, as we show in Section IV, it does not provide metric\nvalues that are comparable across different texture content.\nThe main advantage of these statistical approaches is their\nsimplicity and computational efﬁciency for obtaining the tex-\nture features and carrying out comparisons. However, their\nsimplicity is also their main drawback, as is their failure to\nincorporate models of human perception. Most of these meth-\nods have been applied to limited data sets and applications,\nand are likely to fail in more general problem settings.\nThe spectral methods provide a better link between pixel\nimage representations and human perception. Initially, spectral\nmethods were based on the Fourier transform, but given\nthat the basis functions for Fourier analysis do not provide\nefﬁcient localization of texture features [34], they were quickly\nreplaced by wavelet/subband analysis methods, which provide\na better tradeoff between spatial and frequency resolution.\nMost of the recent spectral techniques extract the energies\nof different subbands, and use them as features for texture\nsegmentation, classiﬁcation, and CBR [27], [35]–[38]. One of\nthe most effective classiﬁcation techniques has been proposed\nby Do and Vetterli [38]; they use wavelet coefﬁcients as\nfeatures and show that their distribution can be modeled as\na generalized Gaussian density, which requires the estimation\nof two parameters. They then base the classiﬁcation on the",

In addition to different spa-\ntial frequency channels, such decompositions are orientation-\nsensitive, mimicking the orientation selectivity of simple re-\nceptive ﬁelds in the visual cortex of the higher vertebrates\n[39]. One example of such decompositions are Gabor ﬁlters\n[40], [41]. Several authors have used features extracted from\nsuch decompositions for a variety of applications (e.g., in [8],\n[35], [36], [42]–[45]). Manjunath and Ma [36] have utilized\nthe mean and the standard deviation of the magnitude of the\ntransform coefﬁcients as features for representing the textures\nfor classiﬁcation and retrieval applications. Then, a measure\nof dissimilarity between two texture images is the normalized\nℓ1 distance between their respective two feature vectors.\nSome methods for evaluating texture similarity combine the\nstatistical and the spectral approaches. For example, Yang et\nal. [46] combine Gabor features and co-occurrence matrices\nfor CBR applications. One of the MPEG-7 texture descrip-\ntors [47], the homogeneous texture descriptor also combines\nspectral and statistical techniques. It consists of the means\nand variances of the absolute values of the Gabor coefﬁcients.\nSince these statistics are computed over the entire image,\nthis descriptor is useful in characterizing images that contain\nhomogeneous texture patterns. For non-homogeneous textures,\nthe edge histogram descriptor partitions the image into 16\nblocks, applies edge detection algorithms and computes local\nedge histograms for different edge directions. The texture\nbrowsing descriptor, attempts to capture higher-level percep-\ntual attributes such as regularity, directionality, and coarseness,\nand is useful for crude classiﬁcation of textures. These three\ntypes of MPEG-7 texture descriptors of MPEG-7 are described\nin detail in [48]. Ojala et al. [16] have shown that the MPEG-7\ndescriptors are rather limited and provide only crude texture\nretrieval results. A number of variations of the MPEG-7\ntechniques have also been developed, e.g., in [49].\nSome of the techniques we have reviewed in this section\nhave been shown to be quite effective in evaluating texture\nsimilarity in the context of clustering and segmentation tasks.\nHowever, there has been very little work towards evaluat-\ning their effectiveness in providing texture similarity scores\nthat are consistent across texture content, agree with human\njudgments of texture similarity, and can be used in different\napplications.

SSIMs can be applied in either the\nspatial or transform domain.

The main difference between\nthe two implementations is that the former is applied directly\nto two images, x = [x(i, j)] and y = [y(i, j)], whose\nsimilarity we wish to assess, while in the latter the images\nare ﬁrst decomposed into subbands, xm = [xm(i, j)] and\nym = [ym(i, j)], using the complex steerable ﬁlter bank [12],\nand includes an extra subband pooling step.

The\nsimilarity values computed for all window positions are then\npooled by averaging to obtain the SSIM value Qm\nSSIM(x, y)\nover all spatial locations.\nIn the complex wavelet version of SSIM (CW-SSIM) [4],\nthe images x and y are ﬁrst decomposed into Nb = Ns·No+2\nsubbands using the complex steerable ﬁlter bank [12]. Here,\nNs denotes the number of scales, No the number of orien-\ntations, and the “+2” accounts for the (innermost) lowpass\nand outermost highpass bands, which are not subdivided into\ndifferent orientations and which have real-valued coefﬁcients,\nin contrast to the complex coefﬁcients of the Ns · No other\nbands. Figure 3(a) illustrates the passbands of the steerable\nﬁlter decomposition with Ns\n= 3 scales and No\n= 4\norientations.

First, steerable ﬁlters, like Gabor ﬁlters, are inspired\nby biological visual processing. Second, the most important\nidea behind the SSIM approach [3] for image quality is the fact\nthat it replaces point-by-point comparisons with comparisons\nof region statistics. However, the “structure” term of (6), which\ngives SSIM its name, is actually a point-by-point comparison.\nThis follows from the fact that the cross-correlation between\nthe patches of two images in (3) is computed on a point-by-\npoint basis. Moreover, Reibman and Poole [51] have shown\nthat the image domain SSIM has a direct connection to MSE.\nThis does not hold for CW-SSIM, which is tolerant of small\nshifts since such perturbations produce consistent phase shifts\nof the transform coefﬁcients, and thus do not change the\nrelative phase patterns that characterize local image features\n[4]. However, the amount of shifts the CW-SSIM can tolerate\nis small and independent of metric parameters. On the other\nhand, pairs of texture images can have large point-by-point\ndifferences and pixel shifts, while still preserving a high degree\nof similarity.\nThus, in order to fully embrace the SSIM idea of relying on\nlocal image statistics, and to develop a metric that can address\nthe peculiarities of the texture similarity problem, we need to\ncompletely eliminate point-by-point comparisons by dropping\nthe “structure” term, and to replace it with additional statistics,\nand comparisons thereof, that reﬂect the most discriminating\ntexture characteristics. This paper proposes a general frame-\nwork for STSIM metrics that take the following form:",

        "text": "In the remainder of this section, we develop metrics that\nextend the ideas of [5] by including a broader set of image\nstatistics. The motivation comes from the work of Portilla and\nSimoncelli on texture analysis/synthesis [11], who have shown\nthat a broad class of textures can be synthesized using a set\nof statistics that characterize the coefﬁcients of a multiscale\nfrequency decomposition (steerable ﬁlters). Based on extensive\nexperimentation, they claim that the set of statistics they\nproposed are necessary and sufﬁcient. Now, if a set of statistics\nis good for texture synthesis, then these statistics should also\nbe suitable as features for texture comparisons. However,\nwhile texture synthesis requires several hundred parameters,\nwe believe that many fewer will sufﬁce for texture similarity.\nAmong the various statistics that Portilla and Simoncelli\nproposed, the proposed metrics adopt the mean and variance\nof the original SSIM metrics, the correlations coefﬁcients of\nthe STSIM-1 metric, and add crossband correlations (between\nsubbands). The argument for adding crossband correlations\nlies in the fact that the image representation by steerable\nﬁlter decomposition is overcomplete, and thus, the subband\ncoefﬁcients are correlated. More importantly, we compute\nthe crossband-correlation statistics on the magnitudes of the\ncoefﬁcients. The raw complex coefﬁcients may in fact be\nuncorrelated, since phase information can lead to cancella-\ntions. As shown by Simoncelli [52], the magnitudes of the\nwavelet coefﬁcients are not statistically independent and large\nmagnitudes in subbands of natural images tend to occur at\nthe same spatial locations in subbands at adjacent scales\nand orientations. The intuitive explanation may be that the\n“visual” features of natural images do give rise to large local\nneighborhood spatial correlations, as well as large scale and\norientation correlations [11].\nThe crossband-correlation coefﬁcient between subbands m\nand n (excluding the lowpass and highpass bands) is computed\nas:",

We\nfound that it is most effective when the statistics are computed\non the magnitudes of the subband coefﬁcients.\nOne of the advantages of this approach is that we can\nadd different weights for different statistics, depending on\nthe application and database characteristics. For example, we\ncould put a lower weight on statistics with large variance\nacross the database, thus de-emphasizing differences that are\nexpected to be large and paying more attention to differences\nthat are not commonly occurring. This can be accomplished\nby computing the Mahalanobis distance [56] between the\nfeature vectors, which if we assume that the different features\nare mutually uncorrelated, is a weighted Euclidean distance\nwith weights inversely proportional to the variance of each\nfeature. We refer to the resulting metric as STSIM-M, where\n“M” stands for Mahalanobis. Note that as a distance this is a\ndissimilarity metric that takes values between 0 and ∞.\nThe feature vector for image or image patch x has a total\nof Np = 4 · Nb + Nc terms and can be written as:",

While this seems to restrict testing to a very speciﬁc\nproblem, we will argue that the conclusions transcend the\nparticular application and have important consequences for\nother image analysis applications, including compression.\nAs we pointed out in Section III, the metrics we proposed\nin this paper are not scale or rotation invariant.

        "text": "For our experiments, we collected a large number of color\ntexture images. The images were carefully selected to (a) meet\nsome basic assumptions about texture signals, and (b) facilitate\nthe construction of groups of identical textures.\nTo address the ﬁrst point, we need a deﬁnition of texture.\nThe precise deﬁnition of texture is not widely agreed on\nin the literature. However, several authors (e.g., Portilla and\nSimoncelli [11]) deﬁne texture as an image that is spatially\nhomogeneous and that typically contains repeated structures,\noften with some random variation (e.g., random positions, size,\norientations or colors). The textures we collected had to meet\nthe requirement of spatial homogeneity and repetitiveness; the\nlatter we deﬁned as at least ﬁve repetitions, horizontally or\nvertically, of a basic structuring element. We also made sure\nthat there is a wide variety of textures and a wide range of\nsimilarities between pairs of different textures.\nTo address the second point, we collected images of what we\nconsidered to be perceptually uniform textures, from which we\ncut smaller patches of identical textures – each of which met\nthe basic texture assumptions. The group of patches originating\nfrom the same larger texture are considered to be identical\ntextures, and thus considered relevant to each other in a\nstatistical sense.\nOur subjective experiments were conducted on two different\ntexture databases, obtained from the Corbis [57] and CUReT\ndatabases [58], [59], respectively.\nTo construct the ﬁrst database, we downloaded around 1000\ncolor images from the Corbis website [57]. All of the textures\nwere photographic, mostly of natural or man-made objects and\nscenes. No synthetic textures were included. The resolution\nvaried from 170 × 128 to 640 × 640 pixels. Roughly 300 of\nthose were discarded, as they did not represent perceptually\nuniform textures. Of the remaining 700 images, we selected\n425 for the known-item-search experiments. To obtain groups\nof identical textures, each of the 425 images were cut into a\nnumber of 128 × 128 patches. Depending on the size of the\noriginal image, the extracted images had different degrees of\nspatial overlap, but we made sure that there were substantial\npoint-by-point differences, such as those shown in Figure 1.\nThe idea was to minimize overlap while maintaining texture\nhomogeneity. In some cases – when the original image was\nlarge enough – we downsampled the image, typically by a\nfactor of two, in order to meet the repetitiveness requirement.\nA minimum of two and a maximum of twelve patches were\nobtained from each original texture. Overall, we obtained 1180\ntexture patches originating from 425 original texture images.\nThe second database was constructed in similar fashion\nusing 61 images from the CUReT database [58], [59], which\ncontains images of real-world textures taken at different view-\ning and illumination directions. We selected images from\nlighting and viewing condition 122 [59]. From each of the\n61 images, we cut out three 128 × 128 patches at random\npositions, making sure that the entire patch overlapped the\ntexture portion of the image. The total number of test images\nwas thus 183. The advantage of the CUReT database is that\nthe textures were carefully chosen and photographed under",

Based on these results, and according to all three\nstatistics, the global STSIM-M and STSIM-2 metrics outper-\nform all other metrics.

The test was applied to each\npair of metrics, and found that all differences are statistically\nsigniﬁcant except the ones listed in Table II, for which the\np-values are greater than α = 0.01.

The results are\nrepresented by the plots of Figs. 6 and 7, which show the\nmean performance ranks for each metric and the conﬁdence\nintervals, for α = 0.01.

The system should then decide\nwhether the two images correspond to identical textures by\ncomparing the probability of the given similarity value under\neach of the hypotheses. The probability density functions for\nthe two hypotheses are modeled by the histograms of metric\nvalues, one for the pairs of identical textures and one for\nthe pairs of non-identical textures. Figure 8 (top) shows an\nexample of well-separated distributions, that correspond to\nthe STSIM-2 metric over the Corbis database. Note that the\ndistribution for identical textures is peaky, which tells us\nthat the metric provides similar values for similar textures\nirrespective of content. This is a much stronger indicator of\nmetric performance than the retrieval statistics of Section IV-B\nbecause it establishes that there is an absolute threshold\nfor metric values above which textures can be considered\nidentical. On the other hand, the distribution for non-identical\ntextures is much broader, which is expected given the variety\nof textures in the database. Figure 8 (bottom) shows an\nexample of distributions with a lot of overlap; these correspond\nto PSNR over the Corbis database. Note that in addition to the\noverlap, the distribution for identical textures is fairly broad.\nGiven the probability density functions, we can compare\nmetric performances by plotting the receiver operating charac-\nteristic (ROC) curve for each metric. The ROC curve plots the\ntrue positives rate (TPR) as a function of the false positives rate\n(FPR). The ROC curves obtained when the different metrics\nwere tested on the Corbis database are plotted in Figure 9.",

This is a common type of failure and\ndifﬁcult for the proposed metrics to handle. In Example C, the\nimages have more or less the same underlying texture except\nfor weak edges that are too sparse to be captured by high-\nfrequency subbands and have too little contrast to be captured\nby the low-frequency subbands. This type of failure is also\ndifﬁcult for the proposed metrics to handle. In Examples D\nand E, the differences are more substantial, but it does not\nhelp that the orientations of the textures of the identical pairs\nare not well matched. Finally, some failures come from the fact\nthat images in our database have different scales. This can be\nseen in Example F, where the retrieved image is a texture at a\nlarger scale than the query image. Note that our metric weights\nsimilarity equally across scales. In general, the metric in its\ncurrent form has difﬁculties handling textures of larger scales.\nThere are a number of possibilities for improvement, e.g., by\nexplicitly detecting the scale of each image.",

The metrics allow substantial point-by-point de-\nviations between textures that according to human judgment\nare essentially identical. They are based on a steerable ﬁlter\ndecomposition and rely on a concise set of subband statistics,\ncomputed globally or in sliding windows. We investigated the\nperformance of a progression of metrics (STSIM-1, STSIM-\n2, STSIM-M) in the context of known-item search, the re-\ntrieval of textures that are identical to the query texture. This\neliminates the need for cumbersome subjective tests, thus\nenabling comparisons with human performance on a large\ndatabase. We compared the performance of the STSIMs to\nPSNR, SSIM,CW-SSIM, as well as state-of-the-art texture\nclassiﬁcation metrics in the literature, using standard statistical\nmeasures. We have shown that global metrics perform best for\ntexture patch retrieval, and that the STSIM-2 and STSIM-M\nmetrics outperform all other metrics.",
