A first relevant\nproblem is to explain the extraordinary mobility of submarine\nlandslides, which has no comparison in subaerial mass\nmovement. Another challenging question is the apparent\ndisparity between submarine landslides that remain compact\nfor hundreds of kilometres and those that disintegrate during\nthe flow, finally evolving into turbidity currents. This problem\nis linked to a central ongoing debate on the relative importance\nof turbidity currents versus submarine landslides in reshaping\nthe continental margin. Based on three epitomic case studies\nand on laboratory experiments with artificial debris flows of\nvarious composition, we suggest a possible explanation for the\ndisparity between compact and disintegrating landslides,\nidentifying the clay-to-sand ratio as the key control parameter.",

        "text": "The present understanding of submarine landsliding is some-\nhow unsatisfactory. On one hand, the analysis of the deposits\nreveals that submarine landslides may acquire extraordinary\nmobility. On the other hand, although the products of mass\nmovement are easily recognised, the dynamic processes of\nsubmarine landsliding have never been observed in full scale.\nMoreover, in contrast to many subaerial landslides, submarine\nlandslides are not accessible without costly oceanographic\nsurveys. As a consequence, we know surprisingly little about\nthe physical processes capable of transporting thousands of\ncubic kilometres of sediments for hundreds of kilometres along\nslopes that are only a fraction of a degree (e.g. Elverhoi et al.\n2002; De Blasio et al. 2005; Breien et al. in press). A better\nunderstanding of submarine landsliding is also highly relevant\nfor prediction of tsunamis (e.g. Harbitz et al. 1993).\nA prime question related to submarine landsliding regards\nthe extraordinary mobility. Run-out ratios (i.e. fall height-to-\ntravel distance) may reach values as low as 0.05–0.01 (De\nBlasio et al. 2006). This occurs on gentle slopes with\ninclination less than 1° in spite of an increased viscous drag\nand a reduced gravity due to buoyancy compared to subaerial\nconditions. A second key question is why some landslides\nremain compact during their flow while others disintegrate\nsubstantially, also developing into a bipartite flow with a high-\nand a low-density layer, commonly referred to as a high and a\nlow-density turbidity current (e.g. Mulder and Cochonat\n1996). Because of the inaccessibility of submarine mass\nwasting, the knowledge gained by oceanographic surveys\nmust be supplemented by experiments and numerical",

However, a\nmajor problem is that the flow volumes used in the experi-\nments are some 1012 times smaller than the ones involved in\nthe largest submarine landslides.

We thus restrict the term ‘fluidisation’ to a\nsituation where the pore fluids obliterate the effect of\nparticle friction. We also remark that in addition to\ncohesion, a debris flow may also include a frictional\ncomponent in the rheology if not fully fluidised. The low-\ndensity layer corresponds to what is commonly referred to\nas the turbidity current, where ‘turbidity’ should refer to a\ncertain low concentration of fine-grained particles in\nsuspension as also proposed by Mulder and Alexander\n(2001), rather than the common interpretation of a turbulent\nregime. The high-density layer refers to what is often\nclassified as the ‘high-density turbidity current’. However,\nas discussed below and previously shown by Breien et al.\n(in press), this high-density layer does not have the\ncommonly described erosive capability as often suggested\n(e.g. Mulder and Cochonat 1996; Baas et al. 2009).",

        "text": "Extensive landslide activity characterises the huge depo-\ncentres beyond the outlet of large ice streams terminating at\nthe Bear Island Fan (Fig. 1a). A significant part of the\nsediments consists of well-defined debris lobes. The lobes in\nthe uppermost part of these sediments were most likely\ndeposited during the last glacial maximum. They are\ntypically about 30 m thick and 10 km wide, and comprised\nof clay-rich material (Laberg and Vorren 2000; Marr et al.\n2002). The astonishing aspect of these debris flows is the\nenormous travel distance of more than 150 km despite an\naverage seafloor inclination of only 0.7°, corresponding to a\nrun-out ratio of only 0.012 (e.g. De Blasio et al. 2006).\nSeafloor mapping and sediment coring reveal rather homo-\ngeneous composition along the whole flow path. Moreover,\nthese debris flows do not seem to be associated with distal\nfine-grained deposits. Thus, they have most likely been\nformed and travelled down the slope as massive non-\nfluidized debris flows with a limited (if any) generation of\nan overriding low-density layer (i.e. a low-density turbidity\ncurrent, e.g. Hampton 1972). It should also be noticed that a\nlimited amount of erosion or erosional features have been\nrelated to the debris flows at the Bear Island Fan complex\n(e.g. Laberg and Vorren 2000). It is believed that rapid\nsedimentation in front of an active ice margin, implying\nsediment instability due to excess pore pressure, may have\ncaused cyclic release of sediments (e.g. Dimakis et al. 2000).",

At a\nvelocity of around 1 m/s, a frame rate of 240 fps would give\na displacement of 25 pixels between two consecutive frames.\nIn addition to the high-speed cameras, two standard digital-\nvideo cameras (PIXCI board cameras) were used to capture\nthe overview (Fig. 3).\nA particle image velocimetry (PIV) algorithm (Sveen\nand Cowen 2004; Pagliardi 2007) applied to the high-speed\ncamera images permitted us to calculate the velocity of the\ndebris flow slurry particles close to the wall. We calculated\nthe velocity field (u and v components) for each image, i.e.\nevery 0.004 s and with a spatial resolution of about 1 mm,\nusing cross-correlation methods between two sub-windows.\nSimilar use of PIV can be found for example in Spinewine\net al.

The pressure\ntransducers were mounted flush with the bed. Druck\nsensors were used to measure the porewater pressure, and\nHoneywell pressure sensors were used for the total pressure.\nThe pressure measurements were done with reference to the\nambient air and therefore affected by barometric changes.\nFor this reason, calibration was performed prior to each set\nof runs. The pore pressure transducers were flushed out\nprior to each experiment to expel any air in the tubes and to\nmake sure the filter pores were not clogged.\nPressure and stress distributions provide important\ninformation regarding flow behaviour and flow regimes at\nwork. Measurements were attempted at upstream and\ndownstream locations (Fig. 3), but the interpretation was\nnot straightforward. We want to stress these complications\nto assist others in similar situations. In some cases,\nmeasured pore pressures were higher than the total pressure\nduring the experiments. This situation is not physically\nconsistent but was nevertheless observed also in earlier\nexperimental studies (Ilstad et al. 2004a; Major and Iverson\n1999). Most likely, the phenomenon is an artefact of the\nmounting of the measuring system and of clogging of the\nfilters. It may also be due to sediment arching and stress\nrelief over the total stress sensor. Due to these complica-\ntions, we do not rely on the pressure measurements alone\nbut use the data to support our observations of velocity and\npossible hydroplaning. Examples of the pressure measure-\nments are shown in Fig. 4. The measurements are complex\nand most likely affected by the flume set-up and thus\nrequire special attention.\nThe initial wiggles (up to t=1–2 s) in the total stress\nmeasurements are flume vibrations triggered by the opening\nof the gate. A pressure rise of about 200 Pa (at t~3 s) is due\nto the release of the 100 l of debris flow slurry from the\nhead tank into the main tank and the resulting increase in\nwater level, before the frontal dynamic pressure arrives.\nThe stress peak (at t=6–7 s) corresponds to the arrival of\nthe debris flow front.

Kaolin is a\nlow reaction clay of density 2.75 g/cm3. The sand and coal\nslag have a density of 2.65 and 2.6 g/cm3, respectively. Note\nthat in these sets of experiments, no silt-sized materials were\nincluded. The reason is that we primarily have focused on\nhow the clay concentration will influence the overall flow\nbehaviour, visco-plastic versus a granular–frictional flow or\nNewtonian fluid. We also refer to the section on scaling in\n‘Section 6’, ‘Section 6.1’ and Appendix). Every run\ncontained 5% coal slag by weight for easier particle tracking.\nThe coal slag is black and easily distinguishable from the\nreddish sand. The density of the mixed slurries was around\n1.8 g/cm3 at release.\nSand–clay–water mixtures of varying concentrations\nwere used. A range of clay concentrations from ‘low’ (5%\nand 10% by weight) via ‘medium’ (15% by weight) to\n‘high’ (20% and 25% by weight) was tested, the sand\ncontent varying correspondingly whilst the water content\nwas kept constant at 28% by weight. Clay concentrations\nless than 5% did not fulfil the requirement of a homoge-\nneous material as the sand grains settled out immediately\nand resulted in a bipartite flow from the start.

In this\npaper, we concentrate on the results obtained with the\nlowest (5%), middle (15%) and highest (25%) clay\ncontents.\nClay and water were mixed in a concrete blender before\nsand and coal slag were added incrementally, with half a\nminute of mixing in between each addition.

The 25% debris flow slurry flows\neasily with a velocity of about 1 m/s and shows no sign of\ndeceleration. It leaves almost no sediment behind (Fig. 7).\nThe velocity profiles show a clear plug flow on top of a thin\nshear zone (Fig. 7c). The frontal snapshot and velocity\nprofile demonstrate marked hydroplaning. The flow moves\nmore or less as a rigid block, and there is a clear\ndemarcation between the body and the head of the flow\n(in some cases, the two parts are almost separated). The\ncoherency suppresses turbulence and results in only a very\nsmall low-density layer; however, Fig. 7c clearly shows that\nthere are two more or less separate layers. As seen from\nvelocity profiles and the colour plot of velocity, throughout\nthe duration of the experiment, the lower high-density layer\ntravels faster than the upper low-density layer.\nThe velocity vectors and velocity profiles reveal that the\ndense layer is laminar (also supported by the Reynolds number\nanalysis below). The fulfilment of the conditions for hydro-\nplaning to occur (including the ability to keep the material\ntogether) causes a lift of the frontal part of the flow (first 20 cm)\nso that it rides on a cushion of water (hydroplaning, e.g. Mohrig\net al. 1998; De Blasio et al. 2004), substantially reducing the\nbasal drag. Equal pore pressure and total stress values\nthroughout the whole flow support that hydroplaning takes\nplace (Fig. 4), as was also observed by Ilstad et al. (2004a).",

This gives the change in velocity over\na given reference length. The stretching rate values are\npresented in Fig. 12. We found that stretching is highest in\nthe clayey flows (up to 1.3 s−1), and the increase with\nincreasing clay content seems exponential (Fig. 12), both at\nthe upstream and downstream stations. We also find that the\nstretching of the body is largest in the frontal parts of the\nflow and decreases towards the tail. This is most pro-\nnounced in the clay-rich flows, showing the importance of\nthe hydroplaning with reduced basal friction as an\nimportant mechanism for facilitating long run-out distances\nfor clay-rich debris flows.\nFrom the flume experiments, we found that one of the\nmost important aspects in debris flow dynamics is the\nability of the flow to preserve its original composition, and\nthis ability is determined by the amount of fines in the\ndebris flow slurry. Hydroplaning, stretching and a low\ndegree of deposition are factors that enhance the run-out of\nclay-rich and coherent flows, and all are linked to the\npresence of clay. In some cases, the stretching can result in\nautoacephalation (Parker 2000), producing outrunner\nblocks and the development of multiple heads (Elverhoi et\nal. 2005; Ilstad et al. 2004c; Nissen et al. 1999; Prior et al.\n1984; Hampton 1972). The elongation of the flowing body\ndue to stretching decreases the thickness of the flow, and\nthe fast-moving head ‘pulls’ the rest of the body. The\nphenomenon is most pronounced in clay-rich flows, which\ninitially produce a small low-density layer, mainly from\ntheir heads, but after some distance, one could expect this\nstretching to result in an increase in potential mixing length\ndue to development of cracks and incorporation of water.",

However,\nfor a low-density layer constituting a significant part of the\ntotal flowing mass (as observed for the Grand Banks and the\nStoregga first phase landslides) to be formed, it is assumed\nthat particles must be brought into suspension not only from\nthe flow head. Hence, the analysis of critical shear stresses\nrefers to the main body of the flow.\nApplying the coefficient values discussed above, the\nfrictional stress associated with a velocity of U≈1 m/s\n(observed in the laboratory experiments and slightly depen-\ndent on the composition; Breien 2009) is between 5 to 10 Pa.\nFigure 13 shows with asterisks the frictional stress as a\nfunction of the clay content. The frictional stress increases\nslightly as a function of the clay content because of the\nincrease in the velocity of the slurry. In the same plane, the\ncritical shear stresses for surface erosion, assumed equal to\n10% of the yield strength, are shown with circles. Their\ndependence on the clay content is much more dramatic\nbecause, as we have discussed, the clay determines a\nsignificant increase of the cohesion. The two lines cross at\na critical clay density, which from the experimental evidence\nfalls between 20% and 25% clay content. A main conclusion\nfrom the laboratory experiments is thus that a bipartite flow\nis expected to occur when the critical shear stress is smaller\nthan the frictional stress (clay-to-sand ratio <20–25%), while\na coherent debris flow occurs when the critical shear stress is\nlarger than the frictional stress (clay-to-sand ratio >20–25%).\nThis is confirmed by the flume experiments.

        "text": "The Storegga landslide, the Bear Island Fan complex and the\nGrand Banks landslide are all associated with glacially\ninfluenced margins. All three landslides originated from\nsediments provided from major ice sheets: (1) the Storegga\nlandslide from the Fennoscandian ice sheet, (2) the Bear Island\nFan landslides from the Barents Sea ice sheet and (3) the Grand\nBanks landslide from the Laurentian ice sheet. In principle, the\nsediment sources are similar, namely, glacially eroded prod-\nucts, a situation likely to provide rather equal conditions and\nproducts. However, as documented from the three locations,\nthe final deposits in the three sites differ strongly. In particular,\nextensive sand deposits on the abyssal plain similar to those\nassociated with the Grand Banks landslide have not been found\nin connection with the other two landslides. As seen from the\nexperiments, the primary composition plays an important role\nin the subsequent behaviour. Initial high clay content—or\ncohesive sediments—provides landslides that may remain as\nmassive debris flows without disintegration. When comparing\nthe source area of the three landslides, they differ in significant\naspects. The source material of the Bear Island Fan complex\nlargely originates from the Barents Sea, an area entirely\ndominated by sedimentary rocks including large amounts of\nshale and fine-grained rocks. Sedimentological and mineralog-\nical analyses of the source sediments demonstrate high contents\nof clay minerals such as illite, chlorite, kaolinite, smectite and\nrandom mixed-layer smectite–illite (Elverhoi et al. 1989; Knies\net al. 2006). A similar assemblage although with a somewhat\ngreater smectite content has been identified in the surface as\nwell as in deeper sections along the margin (Knies et al. 2006;\nForsberg et al. 1999). With respect to the source material, the\nStoregga landslide materials have a mixed source from the\nFennoscandian shield underlain by crystalline and metamor-\nphic rocks with additional supply from the Norwegian shelf,\nunderlain by sedimentary rocks characterised by a high clay\ncontent. It should also be noticed that mineralogical analyses\nof Storegga landslide materials reveal significant amounts of\nsmectite (Forsberg and Locat 2005). Thus, similar to the Bear\nIsland Fan sediments, the Storegga landslide sediments have a\ncohesive nature. The Grand Banks landslide sediments consist\nof a mixture of mud as well as sand and gravel (Piper and\nSlatt 1977; Stow 1981; Piper et al. 1984). Clay mineral\nassemblages show a dominance of illite and chlorite with\nadditional kaolinite as well as some amounts of smectite.\nAlthough the clay mineral assemblages may have some",

The maximum calculated\nvelocity is above 22 m/s. A similar calculation with a non-\nhydroplaning 30-kPa debris flow (BING model) merely\nresults in a small readjustment of the material. To gain a\nrun-out compatible with the observations in the absence of\nhydroplaning, much lower yield strengths should be\nadopted: between 1.5 and 3 kPa (Fig. 14 shows the result\nwith 3 kPa). This range of low values entails a thorough\ntransformation of the rheology, which is not compatible\nwith the sharp edges and the thickness of the Bear Island\nFan lobes. We conclude that the Bear Island Fan debris\nflow did not disintegrate (as also indicated by the clay-rich\ncohesive nature of the Bear Island Fan clay), and that its\ndynamics are well reproduced by our experiments with high\nclay content (Fig. 16a). It should also be noticed that the\nobserved lack of basal erosion between the various debris\nflows at the Bear Island Fan complex (Laberg and Vorren\n2000) may be related to that hydroplaning significantly\nreduces erosion of the antecedent sediments (e.g. Mohrig et\nal. 1999; Harbitz et al. 2003; Elverhoi et al. 2005).\nFigure 15 shows the results for the Grand Banks landslide.\nFollowing our principle, the mechanics of this debris flow\nwere different from the Bear Island Fan debris flows.

Although the results for\nBING and W-BING for the first 200 km of simulations are not\nfundamentally different, the simulations show that if the\nlandslide consists of materials with a low shear strength, high\nvelocities and long run-out distances may be obtained even\nwithout hydroplaning. However, in cases with sufficient\ncohesiveness and velocity of the sliding materials, a subaque-\nous landslide may evolve into a hydroplaning regime (e.g.\nMohrig et al. 1998).

        "text": "debris flows in the Grand Bank landslide area originating\nfrom at least partly muddy sediments (e.g. Piper et al. 1999),\na certain degree of cohesiveness seems likely. Accordingly, a\nhydroplaning scenario may also be likely for the 1929 Grand\nBanks landslide. It is also interesting to notice the observa-\ntion of areas with little or no sign of erosion in the Grand\nBanks landslide area (e.g. Piper et al. 1999). As discussed for\nthe Bear Island Fan complex, this may be related to\nhydroplaning masses.\nIn analogy with the medium and low clay content experi-\nments, it is suggested that after the Grand Banks landslide\nstarted to break up, it continuously lost mass in the form of a\nsand carpet depositing along the abyssal plain as described by\nBreien et al. (in press). Whereas the sand in the distal part\nwas the product of the first phase of high-density fluidised\nlayer of the Grand Banks landslide, the 1-m thick deposits\nappearing only at distances less than 400 km from the\nheadwall might be at least partially the result of the\nsuccessive events in response to the development of a\nretrogressive landslide.\nSimulations of the Storegga first phase landslides reveal\na difficulty in delivering a huge mass of sediment to the\ndeep basin 400–500 km from the headwall applying a pure\nBingham fluid concept (De Blasio et al. 2005). In order to\nobtain the observed long travel distance and velocities of\n25–30 m/s required to generate the Storegga landslide\ntsunami with a retrogressive landslide motion (Harbitz et al.\n1993; Bondevik et al. 2005), the first phase landslide is\nsimulated with hydroplaning and/or a material progressively\nremoulding from 20 kPa to 500 Pa during flow. The high\nvelocities are also required in order to form the low-density\nlayer causing the distal turbidites (Fig. 2). The shorter travel\ndistance of the highly consolidated material in the smaller\nlandslides of the Storegga termination phase (Fig. 2) is\nsuccessfully simulated as a (one-layer) shear softening debris\nflow (Gauer et al. 2005).\nFinally, note that a key requisite for hydroplaning is that\nthe initial velocity of the non-hydroplaning flows has to be\nrelatively high to ignite the process. An initial high velocity\nis a consequence of the initially thick geometry of the\ndebris flow. In a Bingham rheological model (with a more\ngeneral model of Herschel–Bulkley fluid, the argument is\nonly slightly different), the initial acceleration increases\nwith the debris flow thickness D. This is clearly noticeable\nfrom Eq. 8, where the second and third terms on the right\nhand side decrease in magnitude as a function of D. As a\nconsequence, high acceleration may be attained in the\nbeginning of the failure only if the sediment is sufficiently\nthick. However, as the debris flow stretches and becomes\nthinner, the internal resistance becomes comparatively more\nimportant than gravity. Thus, unless hydroplaning starts, the\ndebris flow will stop at an early stage, unless the yield\nstress and the viscosity are very small.",

We suggest that a similar principle could\noccur for natural submarine debris flows. Because the Grand\nBanks landslide potentially had a more granular and less\ncohesive composition, we expect a lower critical shear stress\nfor erosion compared to the Bear Island Fan complex\n(Fig. 13). In our interpretation, the Bear Island Fan complex\ncorresponds to the clay-rich experiments, while the Grand\nBanks landslide is featured by more sand-rich experiments. It\nshould be noted that according to our simulations, the\nsimulated velocities in the Bear Island Fan and the Grand\nBanks differed relatively more than the velocities of the clay-\nrich and sand-rich debris flows seen in the experiments.\nHowever, the higher simulated velocities at the Grand Banks\ncan be ascribed to a greater slope angle. Considering the\nuncertainties involved, the results seem to be compatible with\nour conjecture. Based on velocity estimates, the frictional\nstress in the field may be 500–1,500 times greater than in the\nexperiments, which correspond to maximum values of\nthe order 5–15 kPa. Therefore, the 30 kPa adopted in the\nsimulation of the Bear Island Fan would explain the absence\nof erosion and the maintenance of a cohesive state.

In the\ntable, Lr is runout length (a horizontal quantity), and Qd is\nthe volume discharge (cubic metres per second) of the\ndebris flow. The values for the model are taken from typical\nresults by Mohrig et al. (1998).\nThe values computed above are realistic for both model and\nfield scale (even though the runout length of the laboratory\nexperiments is unknown, most flows were still moving when\nthey reached the end of the flume). This example shows that\nby scaling down the rheological parameters of the sediment\nand scaling up the slope angle, it is possible to model field-\nscale debris flows in the laboratory—at least with regard to the\nbulk properties of the flow.\nIn practical terms, viscosity and yield strength may be\nreduced in the synthetic sediment by adding water to the\nslurry and reducing the clay content or using a different\ntype of clay. As Eqs. 19 and 20 show, the slurry viscosity\nneeds to be reduced. Both water and clay content will\ntherefore usually need to be changed in going from field to\nlaboratory scale. Care has to be taken that this does not\nsignificantly change the exponent α. We may conclude that,\nin general, flow regime transitions will not occur at the\nsame clay content values at all scales. Moreover, different\ntypes of clay may induce different flow behaviour even\nwith the same clay content, and this clay-type dependency\nmay also be scale-dependent.\nFinally, some types of sediment are not well described\nby visco-plastic models (i.e. through viscosity and yield\nstrength) and therefore need to be scaled following different\nconsiderations (Iverson 1997). These include coarse slurries\nor sandy debris flows in which frictional and inertial effects\ndominate. The grain size, d, is significant for shear stresses\nin these kinds of granular flows and for settling velocities in\nsuspension flows.\nFor example, in the turbidity current forming above the\ndebris flow, the settling velocity should scale in the same\nway as the horizontal velocity and the square root of the",

In Eq. 21, however, the\nparticle Reynolds numbers determined by the settling velocity\nand the particle diameter have to be applied, and a suitable\nparticle diameter must be determined by solving the non-\nlinear Eq. 21 for (d)l. In our case, the clay particles in the\nlaboratory roughly correspond to sand particles in a full-size\ndebris flow. This indicates that the turbidity current generated\nby the field-scale debris flow would be competent enough to\nsuspend sand and transport it over considerable distances.\nDespite all these complications, however, most clayey\nflows and many ‘sandy’ flows that are still within the range\nof cohesive (more fines) or transitional (less fines, more\nsand) sediment mixtures, can be scaled in terms of viscosity\nand yield strength.",
