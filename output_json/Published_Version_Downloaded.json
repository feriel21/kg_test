        "text": "1. Introduction  \n \n \n \n \nTexture analysis refers to the branch of imaging science that is concerned with the \ndescription of characteristic image properties by textural features. However, there is no \nuniversally agreed-upon definition of what image texture is and in general different \nresearchers use different definitions depending upon the particular area of application \n(Tuceryan & Jain, 1998). In this chapter texture is defined as the spatial variation of pixel \nintensities, which is a definition that is widely used and accepted in the field. The main \nimage processing disciplines in which texture analysis techniques are used are classification, \nsegmentation and synthesis. In image classification the goal is to classify different images or \nimage regions into distinct groups (Pietikainen, 2000). Texture analysis methods are well \nsuited to this because they provide unique information on the texture, or spatial variation of \npixels, of the region where they are applied. In image segmentation problems the aim is to \nestablish boundaries between different image regions (Mirmehdi et al., 2008). By applying \ntexture analysis methods to an image, and determining the precise location where texture \nfeature values change significantly, boundaries between regions can be established. \nSynthesising image texture is important in three-dimensional (3D) computer graphics \napplications where the goal is to generate highly complex and realistic looking surfaces. \nFractals have proven to be a mathematically elegant means of generating textured surfaces \nthrough the iteration of concise equations (Pentland, 1984). Conversely the ability to \naccurately represent a textured surface by a concise set of fractal equations has led to \nsignificant advances in image compression applications using fractal methods (Distani et al., \n2006) \n \nAn example of image classification is presented in Fig. 1 in which it is possible to uniquely \nidentify the two different textures (left, grass; right, water) by eye. In Fig. 2 the image on the \nleft is a composite image formed from eight Brodatz textures, all of which are represented in \napproximately equal proportions. The right image is a grey-level texture map showing the \nideal segmentation of the textures (Weber, 2004).",

        "text": "vision against machine-based texture analysis approaches. Julesz, an experimental \npsychologist, was an early pioneer in the visual perception of texture (Julesz, 1975). He was \nresponsible for establishing authoritative data on the performance of the human vision \nsystem at discriminating certain classes of texture. He verified that discriminating between \ntwo image textures depends largely upon the difference in the second-order statistics of the \ntextures. That is, for two textures with identical second-order statistics a deliberate amount \nof effort is required to discriminate between them. In contrast little effort is required when \nthe second-order statistics of the textures are different. However, this observation does not \nextend to textures that differ in third- or higher-order statistics, which are not readily \ndiscriminated by eye (Julesz, 1975). This is illustrated in Fig. 3 in which each of the main \ntextured images (left and right) has a smaller area of similar, but subtly different, texture \nembedded within it. In the image on the left both the main and embedded areas have \nidentical first-order statistics, however, their second-order statistics are different making it \nstraightforward to discriminate both regions. In the image on the right both textures have \nidentical first- and second-order statistics and therefore it is only after careful scrutiny that \nthe different textured regions become visible.",

Delineation of the \ntumour volume is based primarily on visual assessment of computerised tomographic (CT) \nand magnetic resonance (MR) image data by a radiation oncologist. Accurately defining the \ntumour, and potential areas of tumour involvement, on CT and MR data is a complex image \ninterpretation process requiring considerable clinical experience. As a result significant \ninter- and intra-clinician variability has been reported in the contouring of tumours of the \nlung, prostate, brain and oesophagus (Weltens et al., 2001; Steenbakkers et al., 2005). This \nvariability has been shown to be significant and heavily correlated with the digital imaging \nmodality used and the image settings applied during the assessment.  \n \nTexture analysis is presented here as a useful computational method for discriminating \nbetween pathologically different regions on medical images because it has been proven to \nperform better than human eyesight at discriminating certain classes of texture (Julesz, \n1975). Section 3 presents statistical texture analysis through first-, second-, and higher-order \ntechniques. Section 4 considers the use of fractal methods for characterising image texture \nthrough the box-counting and Korcak techniques. In section 5 methods are presented for \nimproving the overall efficiency of the texture analysis approach. These are feature \nselection, reduction and classification. Section 6 presents two case studies, which \ndemonstrate the use of these approaches in practical biomedical imaging. \n \n3. Statistical Approaches for Texture Analysis \n \nTo examine an image using texture analysis the image is treated as a 3D textured surface. \nThis is illustrated in Fig. 4 which shows the textured intensity surface representation of a \ntwo-dimensional (2D) medical image. In first-order statistical texture analysis, information \non texture is extracted from the histogram of image intensity. This approach measures the \nfrequency of a particular grey-level at a random image position and does not take into \naccount correlations, or co-occurrences, between pixels. In second-order statistical texture \nanalysis, information on texture is based on the probability of finding a pair of grey-levels at \nrandom distances and orientations over an entire image. Extension to higher-order statistics \ninvolves increasing the number of variables studied. \n \nMany conventional approaches used to study texture have concentrated on using 2D \ntechniques to compute features relating to image texture. This traditional approach has been \nused extensively to describe different image textures by unique features and has found \napplication in many disparate fields such as: discrimination of terrain from aerial \nphotographs (Conners & Harlow, 1980); in vitro classification of tissue from intravascular \nultrasound (Nailon, 1997);  identification of prion protein distribution in cases of Creutzfeld-\nJakob disease (CJD) (Nailon & Ironside, 2000); classification of pulmonary emphysema from \nlung on high-resolution CT images (Uppaluri et al., 1997; Xu et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2006); and \nidentifying normal and cancerous  pathology (Karahaliou et al., 2008, Zhou et al., 2007; Yu et \na., 2009). Higher-order approaches have been used to localise thrombotic tissue in the aorta \n(Podda, 2005) and to determine if functional vascular information found in dynamic MR \nsequences exists on anatomical MR sequences (Winzenrieth, 2006). Extension of these \napproaches to 3D is continuing to develop within the machine vision community. Several \nauthors have reported the application of 2D texture analysis methods on a slice-by-slice",

A complete representation of image \ntexture is contained in the co-occurrence matrices calculated in the four directions. \nExtracting information from these matrices using textural features, which are sensitive to \nspecific elements of texture, provides unique information on the structure of the texture \nbeing investigated. Haralick et al., proposed a set of 14 local features specifically designed \nfor this purpose (Haralick et al., 1973). In practice the information provided by certain \nfeatures may be highly correlated or of limited practical use. A feature selection strategy is \ntherefore useful  with this approach to take account of redundant, or irrelevant, information. \nThis is discussed in more detail in section 5. It is also interesting to note that prior to any \nprocessing the GTSDMs, which are symmetric, can provide some useful information on the \ncharacteristics of the image being studied. For example, the co-occurrence matrix entries for \na coarse texture will be heavily focused along the diagonals relative to the distance d \nbetween the pixels studied.",

A coarse texture will therefore be \ndominated by relatively long runs whereas a fine texture will be populated by much shorter \nruns.

Of these, the Fourier \ntransform is one of the most widely used (Gonzalez and Woods, 2001). Fourier analysis can be \nused to study the properties of textured scenes, for example the power spectrum reveals \ninformation on the coarseness/fineness (periodicity) and directionality of a texture. Texture \ndirectionality is preserved in the power spectrum because it allows directional and non-\ndirectional components of the texture to be distinguished (Bajscy, 1973). These observations \nhave given rise to two powerful approaches for extracting texture primitives from the Fourier \npower spectrum, namely, ring and wedge filters. Working from the origin of the power \nspectrum the coarseness/fineness is measured between rings of inner radius\n1r and\n2r . The",

Fractal Texture Analysis \n \nUntil the introduction of fractals it was difficult to accurately describe, mathematically, \ncomplex real-world shapes such as mountains, coastlines, trees and clouds (Mandelbrot, \n1977). Fractals provide a succinct and accurate method for describing natural objects that \nwould previously have been described by spheres, cylinders and cubes. However, these \ndescriptors are smooth, which makes modelling irregular natural scenes, or surfaces, very \ndifficult. The popularity of fractals has grown considerably over the past three decades since \nthe term was first coined by Mandelbrot to describe structures too complex for Euclidean \ngeometry to describe by a single measure (Mandelbrot, 1977). The fractal dimension \ndescribes the degree of irregularity or texture of a surface. With this approach rougher, or \nmore irregular, structures have a greater fractal dimension (Feder, 1988; Peitgen & Saupe, \n1988; Peitgen et al., 1992). \n \nThe property of self-similarity is one of the central concepts of fractal geometry (Turcotte, \n1997). An object is self-similar if it can be decomposed into smaller copies of itself. This \nfundamental property leads to the classification of fractals into two distinct groups, random \nand deterministic. A good example of self-similarity is exhibited by an aerial image of an \nirregular coastline structure that has the same appearance within a range of magnification \nfactors. At each magnification the coastline will not look exactly the same but only similar. \nThis particular feature is common to many classes of real-life random fractals, which are not \nexactly self-similar. These are referred to as being statistically self-similar. In contrast, \nobjects that do not change their appearance when viewed under arbitrary magnification are \ntermed strictly self-similar. These are termed deterministic fractals due to their consistency \nover a range of magnification scales. The fractal dimension describes the disorder of an",

This is due to the unique mechanism used by each technique to find the \nfractal dimension (Peitgen et al., 1992; Turcotte, 1997). Two approaches commonly used to \ncalculate the fractal dimension of an image are discussed. The first is the box-counting \napproach (Peitgen et al., 1992). The second, which treats the input as a textured surface by \nplotting the intensity at each x and y position in the z plane, calculates the fractal dimension \nusing the Korcak method (Russ, 1994).  \n \n4.1 Fractal Dimension from Box-Counting \nThe box-counting dimension is closely related to the concept of self-similarity where a \nstructure is sub-divided into smaller elements, each a smaller replica of the original \nstructure. This sub-division characterises the structure by a self-similarity, or fractal, \ndimension and is a useful tool for characterising apparently random structures. This \napproach has been adopted in a variety of applications, for example in the characterisation \nof high resolution satellite images (Yu et al., 2007) and in the detection of cracks in CT \nimages of wood (Li & Qi, 2007).

It is implemented by passing a horizontal \nplane through a 3 D surface in a vertical direction to produce an intersection profile. The \npoints of the surface that lie above the horizontal plane are commonly referred to as islands \nand the remaining areas of the plane are lakes. This is equivalent to applying a threshold \nand measuring the area of the islands and lakes that lie above or below the surface. This is \nillustrated in Fig. 9 which shows the result of repeated thresholding on an image of the \ncerebellum for a case of vCJD. A log-log plot of the number of islands, or lakes, whose area \nexceeds A is fitted to a straight line (see Fig. 10). The slope of this line is used to calculate the \nfractal dimension. This approach is termed the Korcak method (Russ, 1994).",

The slope of the straight line plotted through the data is used to determine the fractal \ndimension. \n \n5. Feature Selection, Reduction and Classification \n \nThe texture analysis approaches presented in the preceding sections calculate features that \ndescribe properties of the image, or region, being studied. This information is next used in a \npattern recognition system to classify the objects, or texture patterns of interest, into an \nappropriate number of categories or classes (Therrien, 1989). However, some of the features \ncalculated may be highly correlated and some may contain irrelevant information. Feature \nselection is used to select a subset of features\nps from a given set of p features such that\np\ns \np\nand there is no significant degradation in the performance of the classification system \n(Therrien, 1989; Zongker & Jain, 1996; Stearns, 1976). The reduction of the feature set \nreduces the dimensionality of the classification problem and in some cases can increase the \nperformance of the classification accuracy due to finite sample size effects (Jain & \nChandrasekaran, 1982). Two powerful methods for reducing the number of features are \npresented. These are the sequential forward search (SFS) algorithm and its backward \ncounterpart the sequential backward search (SBS) algorithm (Devijver & Kittler, 1982). The \npattern recognition system must also be capable of partitioning, or clustering, the reduced \nfeature set into classes of similar observations. The K-means algorithm belongs to the \ncollection of multivariate methods used for classifying, or clustering, data and is presented \nbecause of its general applicability in classification problems (Therrien, 1989). \n \n5.1 Feature Selection Using the Sequential Forward Search Algorithm \nThe SFS algorithm is a bottom-up strategy for removing redundant or irrelevant features \nfrom the feature matrix (Devijver & Kittler, 1982). At each successive iteration the feature \nthat produces the largest value of the selection criterion function J is added to the current \nfeature set.

That is, \nbecause features selected and included in the feature subset cannot be removed, already \nselected features determine the course of the remaining selection process. This has \nnoticeable hazards since after further iterations a feature may become superfluous. Another \nlimitation of the SFS approach is that in the case of two feature variables, which alone \nprovide little discrimination but together are very effective, the SFS approach may never \ndetect this combination. To overcome this problem it is useful to start with a full set of \navailable features and eliminate them one at a time. This is the method adopted by the SBS \napproach described in section 5.2. \n \n5.2 Feature Selection Using the Sequential Backward Search Algorithm \nThe SBS is a top down approach, which starts with the complete feature set and removes \none feature at each successive iteration (Devijver & Kittler, 1982). The feature that is chosen \nto be removed is the feature that results in the smallest reduction in the value of the \nselection criterion function when it is removed. In general, the SBS algorithm requires more \ncomputation than the SFS algorithm because initially it considers the number of features in \nthe complete set as forming the subset. Although the SBS overcomes some of the difficulties \nof the SFS approach the resulting feature subset is not guaranteed to be optimal. \nFurthermore, like its counterpart the SBS algorithm suffers from nesting because once a \nfeature is selected it cannot be disregarded. Implementation of the SBS approach is \nanalogous to the SFS approach detailed in section 5.1. The SBS algorithm is computationally \nmore expensive than the SFS algorithm, however, their performance is comparable. Despite",

In \ncurative (radical) radiotherapy planning, delineation of the gross tumour volume (GTV) is \nprimarily based on visual assessment of CT images by a radiation oncologist (Meyer, 2007). \nThe accuracy therefore of the GTV is dependent upon the ability to visualise the tumour and \nas a result significant inter- and intra-clinician variability has been reported in the \ncontouring of tumours of the prostate, lung, brain and oesophagus (Weltons et al., 2001; \nSteenbakkers et al., 2005).",

        "text": "The approach was also found to be insensitive to CT resolution and slice thickness for the \ndata set studied. It was also noticed that discrimination of the bladder, rectum and other \nregion in the coronal and sagittal image planes was comparable to the discrimination \nobtained in the axial plane. This is encouraging given that the coronal and sagittal data sets \nwere produced from the axial data and suffer a loss of resolution because of finite CT slice \nthickness in the axial data acquisition procedure. \n \n6.2 Case Study 2 – Prion Protein Characterisation Using Texture Analysis \nPrion diseases are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases that occur in both animals \nand man (Bastian, 1991). Human prion diseases occur in sporadic, acquired and familial \nforms, the commonest of which is CJD (Ironside, 1998). The accumulation of prion protein \nwithin the brain is a cardinal feature of these diseases and can be identified by \nimmunocytochemistry (Ironside et al., 2000). In this case study immunocytochemically \nstained sections were imaged using a Leica DMR microscope (Leica Microscopy Systems \nGmbH) and texture analysis techniques were applied to study the distribution of prion \nprotein on the images acquired.  \n \nFormalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks were selected from the cerebellum of five \ncases of vCJD and seven cases of sporadic CJD with known codon 129 genotype and \nbiochemical subtype (four cases of sporadic CJD methionine homozygotes type 1 and three \ncases of sporadic CJD methionine homozygotes type 2). From the blocks\nm\n\n5\nsections were \ncut and stained using the monoclonal antibody KG9 and lightly counterstained with \nhaematoxylin. All images were acquired with 256 grey-levels using a\n10\n\nmagnification \nfactor on a\n574\n736 \n (pixel) frame (see Fig. 12). For each of the vCJD and sporadic CJD cases \nin the study cohort, 21 features (GTSDM = 9; GLRLM = 7; Fourier = 4; Fractal = 1) were \ncalculated on eight neuropathologically significant regions of interest. Statistical analysis \nwas performed on each feature using the Kruskal-Wallis test. This is a non-parametric test \nwhich makes no assumption about the distribution of the data (e.g. normality) and is used \nto compare three or more independent groups of sampled data. In this work the results \nwere assessed at the 0.05 significance level. In addition, a Mann-Whitney test was used to \nassess the pair-wise discrimination between groups of sampled data. The hypothesis for the \ntest was that the samples, or feature values, were significantly different between the groups \nbeing considered (Nailon et al., 2000).  \n \nThe Kruskal-Wallis test showed that 18 of the 21 features were able to significantly \ndifferentiate between vCJD and sporadic CJD type 1 and 2 at the 0.05 significance level. The \nMann-Whitney test, also at the 0.05 significance level, identified that 14 of the 21 features \nwere able to significantly discriminate between the patterns of prion protein deposition \nfound in vCJD and sporadic CJD type 1. The Mann-Whitney test also identified that 14 of \nthe 21 features could significantly discriminate between vCJD and sporadic CJD type 2. It is \ninteresting to note that the combination of GLRLM features found to be significant was \ndifferent in the assessment of vCJD with sporadic CJD type 1 than vCJD with sporadic CJD \ntype 2. This implies that different combinations of features may be required for different \napplications. The Mann-Whitney pair-wise significance test between sporadic CJD type 1 \nand type 2 found no features with significant discriminatory power. The results obtained in \nthe study are summarised in Table 1.",

The radii of \nthe final set of filters chosen is summarised in Table 2. The main objective of this work was \nto use texture analysis to investigate and study the distribution of prion protein found in \nvCJD and sporadic CJD. All of the Fourier ring features used showed significant \ndiscriminatory power in discriminating between vCJD and sporadic CJD types 1 and 2. \nHowever, they were unable to discriminate between sporadic CJD types 1 and 2.",

Inner and outer radii of the ring filters used to discriminate between: vCJD and \nsporadic CJD type 1; vCJD and sporadic CJD type 2; sporadic CJD type 1 and sporadic CJD \ntype 2.   \n \n7. Summary \n \nTexture analysis methods are useful for discriminating and studying both distinct and \nsubtle textures in multi-modality medical images. Practical implementation requires careful \nconsideration of the power of the individual features to discriminate between textures. This \nis essential to reduce the influence that heavily correlated features, and features with little \ndiscriminatory power, have on the overall classification. Statistical texture analysis \ntechniques are constantly being refined by researchers and the range of applications is \nincreasing. Fractal approaches, which offer the convenience of characterising a textured \nregion by a single measure, appear more application-specific than statistical approaches and \nrequire more research. Algorithmic advances have been made on the use of full 3D texture \nanalysis approaches and the publications in this area demonstrate that this is a promising \narea of research. This is particularly important given that biomedical image data with near \nisotropic resolution is becoming more common in clinical environments. However, it has \nbeen shown that there is minimal loss of discriminatory power when 2D techniques are \napplied in the coronal and sagittal planes.  \n \n8.
