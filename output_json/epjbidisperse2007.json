        "text": "Abstract. Experiments were performed to provide insight into the ﬂow behavior and structure of bimodal\nmixtures of grains in gravity-driven, free-surface ﬂows. Unsteady unconﬁned ﬂows were produced by re-\nleasing instantaneously a dry granular mass, composed of two particle sizes, over a rough inclined plane.\nAs a result of size segregation, the small particles are found at the bottom of the ﬂow and ﬁnal deposit,\nthe large particles are found at the free surface, but also on the lateral borders and at the front of the\nﬂow. The lateral and vertical inhomogeneous repartitions of particles lead to two main eﬀects that are\ncompletely absent in monodispersed ﬂows. The outline eﬀect results from the accumulation of large beads\non the periphery of the ﬂow depending on the value of the relative friction of each particle species on the\nplane. This eﬀect in turn causes a narrowing of the ﬂow and/or an increase of length of the ﬁnal deposit.\nThe interface eﬀect results of the interaction between layers of diﬀerent size particles and causes the mod-\niﬁcation of the thickness of the deposit. These eﬀects occur simultaneously and their combination leads to\na great variety of behaviors. In this investigation, evidence of the diversity of behaviors is presented as the\nsize ratio, relative friction and concentration of each particle species are varied.",

        "text": "The ﬂow of dense granular matter on inclined planes is\noften encountered in engineering applications involving\nthe transport of materials such as minerals and cereals.\nIt is also common in geophysical situations where rock\navalanches, landslides and pyroclastic and debris ﬂows are\nnatural events consisting in large-scale ﬂows of particles [1,\n2]. Many studies concerning monodisperse dry granular\nﬂows on inclined rough planes are available in the litera-\nture. However, most of these studies were made with ﬂow-\ning beads of the same size [3] or sometimes greater [4]\nthan the beads glued on the plane. But most industrial\nor natural ﬂows do not propagate on a roughness com-\nposed of the same size of particles than the ﬂow. A sys-\ntematic investigation has shown the importance of the rel-\native roughness on the basal friction [5]. Moreover, the\nnatural ﬂows are often polydisperse in size. For example,\ngeophysical events involve complex heterogeneous granu-\nlar material made of particles of various sizes ranging from\nmicrometers to meters, and sometimes mixed with ﬂuids.\nOne question in Earth Sciences, for which we give possible\nclues in this paper, is the surprising long travel of these",

There are a number of mechanisms for\nthe segregation of dissimilar grains in granular ﬂows [6],\nincluding inter-particle percolation, convection [7], inertia,\ncollisional condensation [8], diﬀerential air drag, cluster-\ning [9] and kinetic sieving [10–16], which is the dominant\nmechanism in dense granular free-surface ﬂows. Moreover,\ndue to their position in the velocity gradient, the veloc-\nity of the large beads is greater than the velocity of small\nbeads. This diﬀerence of velocity implies that the large\nbeads go forth to the front [17–19] and are on the sides of\nthe ﬂow (this is a consequence of the lateral spreading of\nthe front [18]). This repartition of large beads can modify\nthe propagation of the avalanche [20]. One consequence of\nthis accumulation of large beads at the ﬂow front is the\nﬁngering behavior which is observed for natural ﬂows but\nalso in laboratory experiments [21,22]. Whatever the poly-\ndispersity of a granular ﬂow, the segregation is systematic\nand modiﬁes the dynamics of the granular ﬂow.",

The\ncombination of these interactions can lead to diﬀerent be-\nhaviors for bidisperse ﬂows.

The ﬁrst approach pro-\nposed by [28] is based on the fact that the components of\nthe stress tensor are deduced from the Coulomb plastic-\nity criterion, in this case, the resulting ﬂow law takes into\naccount the anisotropy of normal stresses [29,30].\nThe second approach uses a parameterization of the\nfriction coeﬃcient µ = tan θ as a function of the avalanche\nmean velocity and the thickness. This law is obtained\nfrom experiments on steady uniform ﬂows over inclined\nplanes [3,31]. This model indicates that the friction force\nexactly balances the force of gravity. In the case of gran-\nular media, experimental data and Coulomb theory show\nthat bed-parallel stresses in quasi-static granular media\nare not simply due to hydrostatic pressure. However, this\nmodel is able to describe the experimental observation of\nsteady uniform ﬂows over a plane for a given range of in-\nclination angles contrary to Savage-Hutter’s type models.\nIt has been also tested for non-uniform experimental [25]\nand numerical [32] ﬂows. Even if we use the results of the\nsecond approach to interpret our results, the aim of this\npaper is not to diﬀerentiate between the two approaches.\nA local rheology linking the stresses (normal stress P\nand shear stress τ) and the shear rate ˙γ for the case of\ngranular ﬂows down an inclined plane was proposed [23,\n33,34]:\nτ/P = µ(I)",

The curve which represents the variation\nof the coeﬃcient of friction µ with the inertial parameter\ntends to µ2 = tan θ2 for large values of I. A representative\ncurve of µ(I) is presented on Figure 3.\nUsing this local rheology for z = 0, the friction coef-\nﬁcient becomes the basal friction of the ﬂow. It has been\nshown [35], for experiments of uniform stationary ﬂows\non a rough plane (λ = 425 µm, d = 135; 225; 275; 325;\n450 µm), that the evolution of this basal friction versus\nthe inertial parameter is compatible with Figure 3. For\nd = dc = 275 µm, the evolution µ(I) is always higher that\nfor the other value of d, and the µ(I) curves do not cross\n(Fig. 4). The knowledge of the upper limit of the coeﬃcient\nof friction at large values of I (µ2) allows one to determine\nthe sorting of the curves µ(I). In other words, for large\n(indexed l) and small (indexed s) beads, if µ2,s > µ2,l (re-\nspectively, µ2,s < µ2,l), whatever the value of the inertial\nparameter I, µs(I) > µl(I) (respectively, µs(I) < µl(I)):\nthe basal friction of large beads on the rough plane is al-\nways smaller (respectively, greater) than the basal friction\nof the small beads on the rough plane. Using a model [5],\nit is possible to calculate θ2 and then µ2 for each diameter\nof ﬂowing bead on a given plane: µ2 is constant for small\ndiameters then increases, presents a maximum for dc of\nthe plane and decreases to zero for greater diameters (see\nFig. 5 for a typical shape of µ2(d)).\nIn the present study, experiments are done with a mix-\nture of large and small beads. Using Figure 5, it is pos-\nsible to determine µ2 for large and small beads (dl, ds)\nand compare them to know which one is the larger one.\nWe see that if ds (abscissa of the black dot in Fig. 5) is",

Each range of beads is considered\nas monodisperse as the width of the distribution is less\nthan 10% of the mean diameter of each class (controlled\nby image analysis). These beads are used for ﬂows and for\nthe rough plane. The plane is made rough by gluing one\nlayer of beads on it (the diameter of these beads is equal\nto λ = 1.4 mm in this paper, the compactness C of the\nplane is measured and it is equal to 0.56). The control pa-\nrameters of this study are the roughness of the plane, the\nangle of inclination, the volume of the mixture, but also\nthe diﬀerent sizes of beads present in the mixture, and the\nconcentration of large beads in the mixture. The variation\nof all these parameters will lead to a huge number of ex-\nperiments, that is why, only the inﬂuence of the diameter\nratio and the percentage of large beads in the bidisperse\nmixture are studied.\nOn this plane, the experiments consist in the instan-\ntaneous release of a ﬁxed volume of beads placed on the\nplane (see details on the experiments on [5]). The volume\nis placed under a hemispherical cap (9.3 cm in diameter),\nwhich is instantaneously removed (Fig. 1(a)). The released\nmaterial ﬂows down the slope, spreads both longitudinally\nand laterally (Fig. 1(b)) and ultimately stops leaving a de-\nposit characterized by its length L, its width W and its\nthickness hstop (Fig. 1(c)). The mass of beads and the\nslope are dominant parameters, we keep them constant to\nstudy the eﬀect of the bidispersity on the ﬂow: the angle of\nthe slope is for the two ﬁrst groups of experiments (group\nA and B) equal to 25◦, for the third group of experiments\n(group C), the angle of the slope is equal to 19◦. The mass\nof beads poured into the cap is weighted before each run\nand is equal to 176 g. We deﬁne %l as the percentage of\nlarge beads present in the mixture.",

The devia-\ntion of the laser sheet is proportional to the thickness of\nthe deposit (hstop). The scale is determined by the devia-\ntion given by a plate whose thickness is known. With this\nmethod, thickness is measured with 100 µm of uncertainty.\nAnother\nmethod,\ndeveloped\nby\nPouliquen\nand\nForterre [25] inspired by a Moir´e method [36] is used.\nA grid pattern made of horizontal black and white lines\nis projected on the plane by an overhead projector. The\nprojection angle is chosen such that the presence of the\ngranular mass on the surface induces a signiﬁcant defor-\nmation of the grid. Pictures of the plane are recorded by a\ncamera positioned perpendicularly to the plane. The local\nshift of the lines from the initial regular pattern (when the\nsurface is free of beads) to the deformed pattern (in the\npresence of a granular mass) is proportional to the local\nthickness of the granular layer.

This is probably due to the\nsmall thickness of the unconﬁned ﬂow in our study.\nDuring the ﬂow, the large beads are at the top of the\nﬂow, they accumulate at the front, and because of the\nspreading of the front, the large beads appear also on the\nsides (Fig. 7(b)) which are static during the ﬂow [18].\nIn order to determine the modiﬁcations of the mor-\nphology of a bidisperse deposit, it is necessary to deﬁne\na reference state.

This loss does not\nexplain the fact that the length is smaller than the length\ngiven by relation (1).\nThe deposit is composed of two superposed layers: the\nsmall beads are at the base and the large beads at the top.\nDue to this repartition of the beads in the deposit the ref-\nerence relation (2) is more appropriate than relation (1).\nBut this relation is valid only for small percentage of large\nbeads: the large beads can be trapped on the deposit of\nsmall beads only if the deposit is long enough. For all\nthe percentages, the length of the deposit left by a bidis-\nperse ﬂow is larger than reference length (2) (Fig. 23). For\npercentages of large beads smaller than 20%, the length\nslightly decreases with an increase of the percentage and\nthe thickness increases. Moreover, all the large beads are\ntrapped in the deposit of small beads. This is in agreement\nwith the fact that the total length is close to be governed\nby the length of the deposit of small beads (i.e. reference\nstate 2), which decreases with the decrease of the mass of\nsmall beads used. For percentages of large beads greater\nthan 20%, the length increases, the shift from reference\nlength (2) corresponds to a decrease of the thickness of\nsmall beads. The thickness decreases and becomes lower\nthan hstop,mono,s even the deposit is composed of the two\nlayers. That shows the thinning down of the layer of small\nbeads.\nIn conclusion, for ds > dc, the length of the deposit\nis smaller than the length of the deposit calculated with\nequation (1) but larger than the length given by equa-\ntion (2). The behavior of these bidisperse ﬂows depends\non the percentage of large beads present in the mixture.

The de-\ncrease of the width of the deposit is then faster than in\nthe monodisperse case. One explanation of this mech-\nanism, called in the following “conﬁning”, could be\nschematically represented as shown in Figure 24. The\nlarge beads create a slow moving barrier at the front\nof the ﬂow. This barrier slows down the ﬂow, and also\nslows down the spreading of the front, preventing the\nﬂow to establish with the width that it would have\nin the monodisperse case. The ﬂow is narrowed. Due\nto the ﬂow, this barrier may break or not. If the bar-\nrier does not break, the ﬂow will stop (Fig. 24(a)).\nIf the barrier breaks, the width of the ﬂow decreases\nand the deposit is composed of one or several ﬁngers\n(Fig. 24(b)). The decrease of the width of the ﬂow (and\nof the deposit) leads to an increase of the total length\nof the deposit due to the use of a ﬁxed volume of beads\nin the cap. With this mechanism, it can be explained\nthat there is a range of percentages of large beads for\nwhich the ﬁngering is possible: there needs to be large\nenough beads to conﬁne the ﬂow and not too many be-\ncause they would stop the ﬂow. This is why we observe\nﬁngering for 30 < %l < 70.\n– If µ2,s > µ2,l, the basal friction of the large beads is\nsmaller than the basal friction of the small beads.

        "text": "The interface eﬀect between the small and the large beads\nlayers takes into account an interface roughness which im-\nplies the diameter dl compared to the diameter of small\nbeads ds, and the compactness of the upper part of the\nlayer of the small beads and of the lower part of the\nlayer of large beads. We could consider the layer of small\nbeads as a “moving rough plane”. But it is not possible to\nuse directly the study of interaction of beads on a rough\nplane [5], because these interactions do not take place on\nglued beads which cannot move, but on moveable small\nbeads. We suppose that if the big ones push the others,\nthis eﬀect is a function of the mass ratio of the two types\nof beads. The parameters of this interface eﬀect, are the\nratio of the diameters dl/ds and the compactness of each\nlayer of beads. If the thickness of the ﬂow is large, we con-\nsider that the compactness of the upper part of the layer of\nsmall beads is equal to the random compactness of a ﬂow\nand is independent of the size of the beads. In this case, the\ndragging eﬀect varies mainly with the diameter ratio. If\nthe thickness of the small beads layer is thin, its compact-\nness can be modiﬁed by the interaction of the small beads\nwith the rough plane. For small bead diameters greater\nthan dc, the compactness is probably smaller than a ran-\ndom compactness. This is due to the fact that the pattern\nof the rough plane is somehow transmitted through the\nthin layer of small beads. For diameters of small beads re-\nally smaller than dc, the compactness of the layer of small\nbeads is probably the same as in the case of a thick ﬂow\nand equal to a random compactness. Consequently, the\ninteraction between the small beads and the rough plane\nmay have an inﬂuence on the large beads layer in the case\nof thin ﬂows.\nThe dragging of the small beads can be quantiﬁed by\ninteresting to the thickness of the small beads deposit.\nFigures 14(b), 20(b), 21(b) show that the thickness of the\ndeposit in the bidisperse case is smaller than the thickness\nobtained for monodisperse ﬂow composed of small beads.\nWe have previously seen in Section 2, that the thickness of\nthe deposit hstop is a characteristic of the rheology of the\nﬂow and should only depend on θ. We conclude that the\ndragging of the small beads by the large ones may lead to\na modiﬁcation of the velocity proﬁle in the layer of small\nbeads. The mean velocity of the small beads is larger than\nin the monodisperse case, and this increase of the velocity\nleads to a decrease of the thickness hstop of the layer of\nsmall beads deposit.",

We can determine, by image\nanalysis, the total contour of the deposit as well as the\ncontour of the deposit of the small beads. The area of the\nlarge beads trapped on the deposit of small beads can be\ndetermined and thus the area ratio deﬁned by the area of\nlarge beads trapped on the deposit of small beads divided\nby the area of the deposit of small beads. We ﬁnd that\nthe trapping occurs for values of the area ratios between\n0.55 and 0.81. In the case of non-trapping (almost no\nlarge beads on the deposit), the area ratio is lower than\n0.01. We set arbitrarily the limit trapping/not trapping\nat 0.1. Table 4 presents the diﬀerent conﬁgurations, for\nwhich the trapping of large beads occurs or does not\noccur. The trapping of the large beads on the layer of\nsmall beads occurs for diameter ratios smaller than 1.68\n(in the case of an angle of inclination equal to 25◦and for\na percentage of large beads equal to 50%). The value of\nthe diameter ratio corresponding to this limit may vary\nwith both the angle of inclination and the percentage of\nlarge beads. We could expect that the limit increases at\nsmall angles and experiments made at 19◦do not give\nany additional information on the limit. The value of\nthe limit is not very sensitive to the percentage of large\nbeads %l as we did not observe any strong change in the\npresence or absence of large beads on the deposit.\nConsequently the thickness of the deposit may be\nlarger than the thickness of the deposit left by a mono-\ndisperse ﬂow of small beads.",

If the basal friction of large\nbeads is smaller than the basal friction of small beads, no\nforces are acting on the outline of the ﬂow. By judiciously\nchoosing the diameter of each class of beads of the bidis-\nperse mixture, this outline eﬀect can be suppressed. If the\nbasal friction of the large beads is larger than the basal\nfriction of the small beads, the bidisperse ﬂow is narrowed\nbecause of the large basal friction of the large beads acting\non the outline of the ﬂow. Diﬀerent phenomena, depending\non the percentage of large beads, appear: rapid stop of the\nﬂow and decrease of the width and the length of the de-\nposit (for large percentage of large beads) or formation of\na ﬁnger and increase of the length (for intermediate value\nof the percentage of large beads). The conﬁning is one\ncause of the increase of the length of bidisperse deposits.\nThese ﬂows are also governed by the interface eﬀects,\nthat are the interaction between the layers of beads and\nthe interaction of the small beads with the rough plane.\nInteractions between layers of beads are of two types: the\ntrapping of large beads on the deposit of small beads and\nthe dragging ahead of the layer of small beads by the layer\nof large beads. By reducing the trapping of the large beads\non the deposit of small beads, the thickness of the small-\nbeads deposit is measurable and decreases due to the drag-\nging of the small beads by the large beads. The dragging is\nalso one cause of the increase of the length of propagation\nof the ﬂow.\nThis work gives a frame to the study of bidisperse ﬂows\non inclined rough planes by pointing out the mechanisms\ninvolved. But for all the bidisperse ﬂows, these diﬀerent\neﬀects occur simultaneously, which implies diﬃculties to\nseparately study and quantify each of these eﬀects. For\nthis, one must determine the adequate parameter values\nfor which it might be possible to emphasize or separate\neach mechanism and study them separately.",
