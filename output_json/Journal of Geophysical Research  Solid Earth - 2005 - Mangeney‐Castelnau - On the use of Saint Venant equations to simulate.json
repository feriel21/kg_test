Recent laboratory studies have investigated the collapse of an initially\ncylindrical granular mass along a rough horizontal plane for different initial aspect ratios\na = Hi/Ri, where Hi and Ri are the initial height and radius, respectively. A numerical\nsimulation of these experiments is performed using a minimal depth-integrated model\nbased on a long-wave approximation. A dimensional analysis of the equations shows that\nsuch a model exhibits the scaling laws observed experimentally. Generic solutions are\nindependent of gravity and depend only on the initial aspect ratio a and an effective\nfriction angle. In terms of dynamics, the numerical simulations are consistent with the\nexperiments for a \u0001 1. The experimentally observed saturation of the final height of the\ndeposit, when normalized with respect to the initial radius of the cylinder, is accurately\nreproduced numerically. Analysis of the results sheds light on the correlation between the\narea overrun by the granular mass and its initial potential energy. The extent of the\ndeposit, the final height, and the arrest time of the front can be directly estimated from the\n‘‘generic solution’’ of the model for terrestrial and extraterrestrial avalanches. The\neffective friction, a parameter classically used to describe the mobility of gravitational\nflows, is shown to depend on the initial aspect ratio a. This dependence should be taken\ninto account when interpreting the high mobility of large volume events.",

Clearly, a large number of time and space scales are\ninvolved, differing by many order of magnitudes. An\nunresolved issue is the continuum description of dense\ngravitational flows, from laboratory scale to the large scales\nof complex geological flows and incorporating the relevant\nenvironmental parameters.\n[4] Dense dry granular flows along inclined planes have\nbeen shown to exhibit a number of characteristics of natural\ngravitational flows [e.g., Felix and Thomas, 2004; Iverson,\n1997; Denlinger and Iverson, 2001] and have been thor-\noughly investigated [Gray et al., 1999; Pouliquen, 1999;\nPouliquen and Forterre, 2002]. Simple continuum hydro-\ndynamic models, based on the long-wave approximation\n(LWA) [Savage and Hutter, 1989] and Saint Venant equa-\ntions, have been shown to reproduce basic features of both\nexperimental dense granular flows along inclined planes\nand geological flows along real topographies [e.g.,\nDenlinger and Iverson, 2001; Naaim et al., 1997; Pastor\net al., 2002; Pouliquen and Forterre, 2002; Mangeney-\nCastelnau et al., 2003; Pitman et al., 2003; Denlinger and\nIverson, 2004; Iverson et al., 2004, Sheridan et al., 2005].\nThe LWA is a natural approximation for these flow regimes",

Continuum\nmodels are expressed in terms of the change of the vertically\naveraged velocity field and of the associated vertical length\nscale h, i.e., the avalanche thickness, and describe hydro-\nstatic imbalance [Mangeney-Castelnau et al., 2003] or\nnonhydrostatic plasticity and friction effects [Savage and\nHutter, 1989]. The models assume an averaged friction\ndissipation described phenomenologically in the framework\nof Coulomb’s friction with a constant [e.g., Hutter et al.,\n1995; Naaim et al., 1997] or velocity- and height-dependent\n[Pouliquen, 1999; Douady et al., 1999] friction coefficient.\n[5] Although quite important in terms of risk assessment,\ncliff collapse, which involves mechanisms of mass spread-\ning quite different from classical flows, has been the subject\nof fewer studies. Recently, laboratory experiments involving\ncollapse and spreading of a granular mass have been\nperformed by Lajeunesse et al. [2004] and Lube et al.\n[2004]. In both experiments a granular mass of cylindrical\nshape was suddenly released on a quasi-horizontal surface.\nThe main conclusion is that the spreading and final deposit\nare controlled by the aspect ratio of the initial mass.\nDepending on the initial aspect ratio a, two different flow\nregimes are identified. Empirical relations were derived\nrelating the runout distance and the height of the deposit\nto the initial aspect ratio a of the cylindrical mass.\n[6] The aim of this paper is to investigate these experi-\nments numerically. Two approaches are possible. Discrete\nelement methods make use of an explicit description, at the\nparticle scale, of the behavior of the granular mass and make\nit possible to take into account nonhomogeneous deforma-\ntions and potential localization patterns during the collapse\n[e.g., Mu¨ller, 1995; Staron and Hinch, 2004]. Although this\napproach provides insight into the mechanical behavior of\nthe granular mass during spreading, its application to large\nextended systems is difficult for computational reasons. A\ncontinuum-like approach is therefore needed. As previously\nmentioned, continuum hydrodynamic models based on the\nLWA and Saint Venant equations have been widely used to\nsimulate granular flows along inclined planes or topogra-\nphy. In this case, the LWA is a natural approximation due to\nthe small aspect ratio of the flow d = H/L, where H is the\nheight of the flowing material and L the running distance.\nObviously, such a geometrically based argument is not\nnecessarily relevant in collapse experiments. However, note\nthat the LWA is a kinematic approximation based on the\nexistence of a spatial scale, e.g., the vertical scale, below\nwhich rapid fluctuations of the velocity field can be\nsmoothed out through a vertical averaging, and small\nvertical accelerations. Therefore for a leading order approx-\nimation, classical LWA gives flow models characterized by\na weak hydrostatic imbalance on the vertically averaged\nhorizontal velocity of an incompressible fluid possessing a\nfree surface and moving under the force of gravity. Al-\nthough simple geometrical scaling arguments cannot be\nused for mass collapse experiments, it is hard to know a\npriori if LWA can or cannot be applied to describe the\nspreading. In fact, the initial geometry is not preserved\nduring the spreading, leading to a lower aspect ratio\ngeometry. Moreover, the flow, at a distance r > Ri from",

Where comparison is possible, the results of the\nanalytical and numerical approach performed by Kerswell\n[2005], also based on Saint Venant equations with Coulomb\nfriction, appear consistent with those reported here. This\nstudy shows that the spreading of granular columns are\npurely extensional. Only one of the Earth pressure coeffi-\ncients reflecting whether the material is locally extending or\ncontracting [Savage and Hutter, 1989] is then relevant and\nthis can easily be scaled out of the problem. Furthermore the\ndiscrete element simulation performed by L. Staron and E. J.\nHinch (Study of the collapse of granular columns using\nDEM numerical simulation, submitted to Journal of Fluid\nMechancis, 2005) provides insight into the heterogeneous\nbehavior of granular collapse.\n[9] We first briefly describe, in section 2, the experimen-\ntal results used for this study. Then after a short presentation\nof the model, a scaling analysis of the LWA model is\nperformed in section 3, providing new insight into the\nexperimental observations. A qualitative comparison be-\ntween the experimental and numerical results is presented\nin section 4 where the accuracy and the intrinsic limitations\nof the LWA approach are discussed. In section 5, the\ndependence of the deposit morphology on the control\nparameters is investigated numerically and empirical scaling\nrelations, similar to those derived experimentally, are pre-\nsented. Finally, in section 6, implications of the simulations\nto the spreading of large volumes are discussed with\nreference to geological observations.",

        "text": "angle of repose corresponds to the angle of the pile after\navalanche. The density of the glass beads is r0 = 2500 kg\nm\u00043 and the mean density of packing of the granular\ncolumn is roughly estimated as f \u0003 0.62–0.65, a typical\nvalue for dense initial heaps [Daerr and Douady, 1999].\n[11] The granular material enclosed inside the tube is\nsuddenly allowed to spread, by removing the tube, on the\nhorizontal plane. When released, the granular mass collap-\nses and spreads until it comes to rest and forms a deposit, as\nshown in Figure 1, where the same experiment is performed\nnumerically. The change of the granular mass with time is\nmonitored by a high-speed camera. Profiles h(r, t) of the\ngranular mass are measured as a function of time t along\nwith the radial distance r from the axis of symmetry of the\ngranular mass. More details are given by Lajeunesse et al.\n[2004]. Among other parameters, experiments were per-\nformed for different initial masses M and different initial\naspect ratios a = Hi/Ri of the granular column. The\ninvestigated range of aspect ratios varies from a \u0003 0.2 to\na \u0003 20. The accuracy of the experimental measurements\ndecreases as the initial aspect ratio increases. For such\ninitial shapes, motion occurs before the tube has been\ncompletely removed.\n[12] Lajeunesse et al. [2004] showed that the spreading of\nthe granular mass can be classified into two different flow\nregimes depending on the initial aspect ratio a of the\ngranular mass. In the first regime, for a < 3, the spreading\nof the granular mass is accommodated by surface ava-\nlanches along the flanks and only a fraction of the initial\ngravitational energy is actually dissipated. The morphology\nof the deposit makes it possible to subdivide this regime.\nFor a < 0.74, the flow ends before complete consumption of\nthe undisturbed central region by the avalanche: the char-\nacteristic shape of the final deposit is a ‘‘truncated cone’’ of\nheight Hf = Hi with an angle close to the angle of repose of\nthe beads qr = 21\u0004. For a > 0.74, the avalanche completely\ndestroys the central region. The characteristic shape of the\ndeposit is a cone of height Hf < Hi. In the second regime, for\na > 3, the initial gravitational energy is almost totally\ndissipated by the flow. While for 0.74 < a < 3, the final\ndeposit is characterized all along the profile by a positive\ncurvature, for a > 3, it is characterized by an inflection\npoint, i.e., the transition between an outer region of negative\ncurvature and a central region of positive curvature, leading\nat the end to a ‘‘sombrero’’ shape with a large and almost\nflat outer region and a steep central cone. Experiments\nsuggest that the spreading results from surface flows in-\nvolving a significant number of glass beads. Furthermore,\nthe shape of the deposit, normalized by dividing by the\ninitial radius, as a function of the normalized radius h(r/Ri)/\nRi is shown to be independent of the mass M but to vary\nwith the aspect ratio a. For a > 0.74, Hf /Ri is observed to\nsaturate roughly approaching a value of the order of 0.74.\nThis value has been associated with the angle of a failure\nsurface within the granular column occurring upon removal\nof the tube dc \u0003 tan\u00041(0.74) \u0003 36, 5\u0004 [Lajeunesse et al.,\n2004]. The rescaled front velocity and the amount of energy\ndissipated during the flow also appear to be independent of\nthe mass but to vary with a. The results are shown to be\nindependent of the nature of the bed and of the bead size.\n[13] In the following, we perform the numerical simula-\ntion of these experiments using the LWA and a depth-",

Therefore a simple procedure was\nadopted: the friction angle d was first estimated by direct\ncomparison between laboratory experiments involving the\nmost favorable case, case 1, for which precise experimental\nobservations were available, and then kept constant for the\nother cases.\n[32] Numerical simulations show very similar dynamics\nfor different values of the friction angle d, d 2 [32\u0004, 34\u0004],\nuntil roughly t ’ 120 ms (Figure 2). The height h and flux\nhu profiles, corresponding to d = 30\u0004, d = 32\u0004, and d = 34\u0004,\nare found to be almost identical as shown in Figure 2b for t =\n80 ms. Even though the deposit appears to depend weakly\non the friction angle, differences in the h and hu profiles\nappear just before and during the arrest phase, as experi-\nmentally observed within the range of friction angles (30\u0004 <\nd < 35\u0004) explored by Lube et al. [2004] using different types\nof material such as sand, salt, couscous grains, rice or sugar.\n[33] Numerically, mass spreading is found to stop at t \u0003\n160 ms, for d = 34\u0004. The final deposit is obtained at t \u0003\n180 ms for all the three values of d as shown in Figures 2c\nand 2d. The main differences between the three profiles are\nobserved at the top while the front region remains quite\nsimilar.

        "text": "4.2.\nComparison Between Numerical and\nExperimental Results\n[35] For small aspect ratios, a < 1, the overall collapse\nand spreading observed in laboratory is globally represented\nnumerically by the model. The dam-break-type behavior of\nthe profile of the granular mass with time, measured by\nlaboratory experiments, is well reproduced by the numerical\nexperiments, as observed in Figure 3 for the initial aspect\nratios a = 0.56 and a = 0.8. Moreover, the behaviors of the\nfront and the deposit are found to be in very good agreement\nwith the laboratory measurements, and differences only\nappear in the vicinity of the highest zone of the deposit\nand at the front. The deposit in the numerical experiment,\ncorresponding to a = 0.8, exhibits a slightly steeper profile\nin the highest region than actually measured in the labora-\ntory experiment. The front, for both a = 0.56 and a = 0.8, is\nfound to be more spread out in numerical experiments than\nin laboratory experiments. While the position of the front,\nmeasured in laboratory and numerical experiments, pro-\ngresses in a very similar way during most of the experiment\n(see Figure 3c for a = 0.56 at t = 160 ms and Figure 3g for\na = 0.8 at t = 180 ms), the final movement of the front is\nfound in laboratory experiments to progressively retropro-\npagate (see Figures 3d and 3h). Such retropropagation may\nbe explained by a loss of mass at the front during the arrest\nphase in laboratory experiments.\n[36] Numerical estimations of the times at which the front\nstops are of the same order as those measured in the\nlaboratory by Lube et al. [2004], although slightly lower.\nFor a = 0.56, Lube et al. [2004] actually measured a\nnormalized time t/\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\nRi=g\np\n\u0003 2.2 leading to t \u0003 186 ms,\nwhile numerical estimations give ts \u0003 170 ms. For a = 0.8,\nlaboratory estimations are t/\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\nRi=g\np\n\u0003 2.7 leading to t \u0003\n230 ms, while numerical estimations give ts \u0003 200 ms.\nHowever, when taking a closer look, the arrest phase\nappears quite different in the numerical experiments com-\npared to the actual observations of Lajeunesse et al. [2004]\nfor laboratory experiments. In laboratory experiments, for\nboth a = 0.56 and a = 0.8, the arrest phase is observed to\nstart at the front edge of the spreading mass and then to\npropagate toward the highest zone. When the front stops, a\nlate relaxation of the highest deposit region is observed\nleading to a smaller slope after t = 180 ms for a = 0.56 (see\nFigures 3c and 3d) and after t = 200 ms for a = 0.8 (see\nFigures 3g and 3h). This relaxation seems to be accommo-\ndated by shallow surface flows smoothing out the highest\nzone of the deposit. In numerical experiments, the arrest\nphase is different for a = 0.56 and a = 0.8. For a = 0.56, it\nappears to initiate in the vicinity of the front (see Figure 4a\nat t = 162 ms) and then to propagate both toward the front\nedge and the center of the mass. Finally, the center of the\nmass first comes to rest at t = 167 ms (see Figures 4b and\n4c), while the whole mass comes to rest only later. For a =\n0.8, the arrest phase appears to start in the central part of the\ngranular mass and then to propagate outward from the\ncenter to the spreading front (see Figures 4d–4f). In\nlaboratory experiments, arrest phase propagation is found",

Such an edge does not appear in\nthe profiles derived from numerical experiments based on\nan initial cylindrical profile or the laboratory-derived profile\n1. The exact mechanism that leads to such an edge pattern,\nwhich has also been observed by Daerr and Douady [1999]\nin a slightly different context, remains open to question.\nWhen the laboratory-derived profile 2 is used initially, the\nedge pattern is actually initially imposed in the numerical\nexperiment. However, even in this case, the edge pattern\ndoes not evolve as observed in laboratory experiments.\nWhile the edge pattern remains stationary and is progres-\nsively smoothed out in laboratory experiments (Figures 6b\nand 6c), the edge propagates in numerical experiments, as a\nshock wave, toward the highest region without smoothing.\nA discrete element simulation by Mu¨ller [1995] of granular\ncollapse experiments, somewhat related to this study, does\nseem to reproduce the laboratory observed type of evolution\nof such an edge pattern, which can be related in this study to\nthe localization of the deformation within the granular mass\nand the formation of a slip surface. Such a step pattern\nwould therefore be related to nonhomogeneous deformation\nand shear zone evolution within the granular mass, a mode\nof deformation that is clearly outside the conditions for\nvalidity of the LWA and any vertically integrated model. On\nthe basis of the numerical experiments, the occurrence of\nsuch an edge pattern does not seem to alter the global\naveraged spreading and the final deposit that are mostly\ncontrolled by the overall energy imbalance associated with\nthe initial collapse conditions, rather than by second-order\nnonhomogeneity effects, consistent with the underlying\nprinciples of depth-average models.",

For these configurations, we would expect the main\nshape changes of the granular mass, and in particular the\nfinal deposit, to be correctly depicted by the macroscopic\nbalance inferred by the integrated governing equations of\nthe model despite some possible localization of the defor-\nmation within the bulk.\n[43] This comparison confirms the existence of two\nregimes. The first, for low initial aspect ratios, corresponds\nto experiments a = 0.56 and a = 0.8 for which the model\nprovides an appropriate description, and the second, for\nhigh initial aspect ratios, corresponds to experiment a = 5.4\nfor which the dynamics are not correctly modeled.

In that case, vertical accelerations and\nvertical velocities may become significant and incompatible\nwith the physical assumptions of the depth-integrated model.\nMoreover, such a dynamic initial vertical collapse may\ngenerate high air pressures in the pores of the granular\nmaterial, and pore pressure changes within the granular\nmass may play a paramount role in the propagation of\nspreading during which an undrained behavior could pre-\nvail. Note once again that the existence of a small flow\naspect ratio, a condition generally used for scaling argu-\nments is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the\nLWA which relies on kinematic scaling arguments between\nthe vertical and horizontal velocity fields and on the vertical\nacceleration field, as illustrated in various fields of geo-\nphysics such as ice sheet flow modeling, where the shallow\nice approximation has been shown to accurately reproduce\nthe flow of the ice in the dome region [Mangeney and\nCalifano, 1998]. Part of the LWA ability to depict these\nexperiments is also expected to be related to the fact that the\ninitial geometry is rapidly smoothed out, leading to lower\nflow aspect ratio geometries during the dynamic phase.\nFurthermore, the region located at a distance r from the\ncenter of the mass r > Ri is subject to shallow flow while the\nregion r < Ri is expected to involve essentially surface flow.\nAlthough a model involving both static and fluid granular\nlayers [Douady et al., 1999; Aranson and Tsimring, 2002]\nwould probably provide a more appropriate framework to\ndescribe the flow for r < Ri, the simple LWA is still expected\nto represent the dynamics when a significant part of the\ncolumn is actually flowing and when the static fluid\ninterface does not vary vertically to a great extent in space\nand time.\n[44] When the mass begins to stop, an arrest phase is\nobserved both in laboratory and numerical experiments, and\npropagates within the granular mass. The disagreement\nbetween laboratory and numerical observations of this arrest\nphase suggest that our minimal model should be extended to\ncapture a more complex behavior of the granular mass\nduring spreading. Note also that laboratory observations\nshow differences in the arrest phase when measured from\nthe top or the base of the granular mass [Lube et al., 2004].\nLaboratory experiments suggest that the arrest phase\ninvolves both a horizontal and a vertical propagation of\ntransition between static and fluid material, with a vertical\npropagation toward the surface inducing shallower ava-\nlanches. Such a consolidation phase cannot be reproduced\nby the minimal model in its present formulation. Such a\nstatic/fluid boundary propagation may be explicitly taken\ninto account within the framework developed by Douady et\nal. [1999] or Aranson and Tsimring [2002]. This consoli-\ndation phase could also be related to a pore pressure\ndecrease at the base of the granular material and would\nrequire, in this case, a kind of mixture theory taking into\naccount effective stresses and interactions between a solid\nskeleton and pore fluids [Pastor et al., 2002; Iverson and\nDenlinger, 2001].\n[45] The incapacity to correctly reproduce the occurrence\nand the changes of the edge pattern observed in laboratory\nexperiments, as previously discussed, may be related to the\nfact that vertically integrated models cannot correctly de-",

Introduction of\nboth a static and flowing phase, or of a mixture theory,\nwould lead to parabolic-hyperbolic equations, allowing\nshocks with nonzero thickness and different propagation/\ndiffusion modes.\n[46] Detailed analysis of the heterogeneous behavior of a\ncollapsing granular mass requires the use of numerical\nmodels at small scale using discrete elements [e.g., Mu¨ller,\n1995; Staron et al., 2002]. Although this is beyond the\nscope of this study, we will note here some of the results of\nthis type of simulation. A discrete element simulation of the\ncollapse of a rectangular granular mass was performed by\nMu¨ller [1995]. This numerical experiment is quite different\nsince the beads flow over a smooth bed and the granular\nmass reaches the right end of the box before the front stops.\nMoreover, the initial ratio Hi/d, where d is a characteristic\nbead diameter, is of the order of 20 whereas Hi/d \u0003 100 in\nthe spreading experiments of Lajeunesse et al. [2004] and\nLube et al. [2004]. Nevertheless, these simulations provide\nsome insight into the flow dynamics. First a relatively deep\navalanche occurs along an inclined surface of rupture of\nabout 60\u0004, then the motion propagates within the granular\nmass leading to a relatively stable avalanche along the\nsurface of slope 30\u0004 with a shallow horizontal flow in the\nfront part. The existence of a first and second fracture was\nalso experimentally observed by Daerr and Douady [1999]\nand is consistent with the interpretation made by Lajeunesse\net al. [2004]. The minimal model considered here, based on\na vertically integrated model, cannot describe such mecha-\nnisms. However, as suggested in section 4.3, the details of\nthe initial collapse seem to have a negligible effect on the\nmean behavior of the flow and on the final deposit. The\ncomparison between continuum and discrete modeling\nrequires further investigation, which is in progress.",

Clearly, for\na < 0.7, the normalized height increases linearly with a, as\nin the laboratory experiments, a direct consequence of the\nfact that Hf = Hi for a truncated-cone-like deposit. For a >\n0.7, Hf/Ri saturates toward a value of the order of 0.7 as\nobserved in Figure 8a.\n[52] A striking result of these numerical experiments is\ntheir ability to reproduce the value Hf/Ri = 0.7 related to the\ntangent of a critical angle dc ’ 35\u0004. The physical interpre-\ntation of this angle remains open to question. This angle was\nassociated with an active Coulomb-yielding process within\nthe granular column upon removal of the tube and to a\nrelated failure surface of angle dc. Since our numerical\nmodel is based on an vertically averaged continuum de-\nscription, which cannot take into account such a hete-\nrogeneous mode of deformation, the validity of this\ninterpretation may be questioned. The dependence of this\nangle on the initial geometry of the released mass has been\ninvestigated numerically by considering both paraboloidal\nand conical initial shape conditions. The resultant angle\nvalues are shown in Figure 9 and depend on the initial\ngeometry. The saturation value of Hf/Ri is found to be\nHf /Ri = 0.65 for an initial paraboloidal shape, and Hf/Ri =\n0.64 for an initial conical shape, corresponding to angles\ndp ’ 33\u0004 and dt ’ 32.5\u0004, respectively. The angle dt is found to\nbe close to the effective friction angle d used in the numerical\nmodel. Indeed, in the model, a conical mass should remain at\nrest as long as its slope remains lower than tan (32\u0004) ’ 0.62\n(see Figure 8c), as discussed in section 3.1. It would be\ntherefore possible to roughly calibrate the effective friction\nangle d of the numerical models by simply measuring the final\nnormalized height of the deposit resulting from the spreading\nof a conical granular mass of known initial basal radius. Such\na calibration procedure would be much simpler than\nperforming laboratory experiments to measure the limiting\nangle of stability of a granular cone over a given substratum.\nHowever, such a procedure is not appropriate if the formalism\nproposed by Savage and Hutter [1989], involving kactpass, is\nused. In this case, the equation of equilibrium of the cone is\nmore difficult to solve and involves now two parameters fbed\nand fint.\n[53] The final radius Rf of the spreading mass is deter-\nmined by the extent of the granular mass with a height\nhigher than a lower cutoff of two bead diameters. The\nnormalized runout distance, measured by Rf/Ri, is also in\ngood agreement with the experiments up to a value a \u0003 1.\nFor larger values of a, the numerical simulation overesti-\nmates the runout distance. As discussed above, for such\nlarge values of the aspect ratio, a substantial part of the\nenergy is converted into vertical kinetic energy, a feature\nthat precludes the LWA. The runout distance is more\nsensitive to the initial shape of the released mass\n(Figure 9b). The normalized runout Rf/Ri is obviously\nsmaller for a paraboloidal shape and even much smaller\nfor a conical shape due to the lower initial potential energy\nof the granular mass for a given Ri. As shown in Figure 9b,\nfor an initial conical shape the granular mass begins to\nspread, i.e., Rf/Ri > 1, for a \u000b 0.64. The normalized final\nextent Rf/Ri decreases with increasing d for a given a. While\nRf/Ri decreases continuously for a = 0.9 (20\u0004 \u0001 d \u0001 30\u0004), it",

The small\nvalues of me deduced from geological observations are\ngenerally interpreted as evidence of a low apparent coeffi-\ncient of friction implying small friction angles in numerical\nmodels. Moreover a physical interpretation of the observed\napparent decrease of the effective friction in the case of high\nvolume events is still open to question (see Legros [2002]\nfor a review). Within this study, the effective friction may be\ndefined as the ratio Hi/Rf. Both experiments and numerical\nsimulations show that me increases with a (Figure 11). A\nnumerical fit of the experimental data shows that me is\nproportional to the square root of the aspect ratio. Such a\nscaling relationship can be directly derived from the dimen-\nsional analysis of the proposed minimal model where the\neffective friction is defined as",

This\nis consistent with an interpretation in terms of two regimes.\nFor small aspect ratios, only a few parts of the granular\nmaterial are actually in motion, leading to a weak global\ndissipation. As a increases, larger amounts of material are\nmobilized and the energy dissipation increases. This is\nconsistent with the experimental results shown by\nLajeunesse et al. [2004] which show the dissipation of\nonly a fraction of the initial potential energy in the first\nregime while, in the second regime, dissipation of almost\nthe whole initial gravitational energy is observed. Geolo-\ngically the height of the released mass is limited by the\nheight of the relief. For extremely large volumes, an\nincrease in the mass involved in the destabilization is then\nexpected to result from a lower aspect ratio, leading to a\nlower effective friction me (Figure 11). This may possibly\nexplain why very large masses have greater mobility\ndepending on the actual volumes involved.\n[56] The overall numerical experiments show that, in the\ndomain of validity of the LWA, i.e., a < 1, the effective\nfriction is lower than the coefficient of friction actually used\nin the model, i.e., m = tan (32\u0004) = 0.62. In fact, it is clear\nfrom Figure 11 that the effective friction does not corre-\nspond to the empirical friction angle d.",

The best fit leads to a\npower law relation with an exponent in the range 0.58–0.68\n(the 95% confidence interval) [Dade and Huppert, 1998].\n[58] When using the dimensionless generic solution (8),\n(9), and (10), the final height, runout and time of deposit of\na granular mass, characterized by its initial aspect ratio a\nand radius Ri, can be deduced from the scaling relation\ndisplayed in Figure 9. Note that such a scaling relation is\nalso meaningful for extraterrestrial collapses, due to the\ninvariance of the dimensionless solution with respect to\nacceleration due to gravity g. While such an invariance\nleads to the same deposit area for terrestrial and extrater-\nrestrial events, the potential energy does depend on g. This\nmakes it possible to report (Figure 12) numerical results, in\nterms of the deposit area and initial potential energy, with\nthe observations of Dade and Huppert [1998]. Acceleration\ndue to gravity was taken to be g = 9.81ms\u00042, g = 3.7ms\u00042,\ng = 1.6ms\u00042 for the Earth, Mars and the Moon, respectively.\nThese new numerical points are found to follow the same\ntrend as the geological data both for terrestrial and telluric\nconditions despite the fact that our minimal model may\nappear rather simplistic with regard to the complexity\ninvolved in the natural events. Note that here the friction\nangle d = 32\u0004 has been kept constant with no attempt to fit\nthe actual data. When using d = 20\u0004, a more extended area is\nobtained (black triangles in Figure 12) which also falls in\nthe range of the observed area. It is possible to represent\nanalytically the observed correlation between the avalanche\narea and its initial potential energy.\n[59] The initial potential energy of a cylinder of radius Ri\nand height Hi is given by",

        "text": "[60] In this paper we propose a minimal model based on a\nlong-wave kinematic approximation and a simple Coulomb\ntype effective friction. The dimensionless analysis of the\ngoverning equations (1)–(4) of the model is consistent with\nthe experimental observation that the dynamics of spreading\ndepend on the initial aspect ratio a but not on the initial\nmass, and the dimensionless equations do not depend on\nacceleration due to gravity.\n[61] Numerical experiments, using such a minimal model,\nare in good agreement with the laboratory experiments of\nLajeunesse et al. [2004] on the spreading of granular\ncylinders on a horizontal plane, at least for regimes\ncorresponding to an initial aspect ratio a \u0001 1. In such a\nregime, numerical experiments correctly reproduce labora-\ntory experiments during dynamic spreading up to the arrest\nphase, and the dynamics seems to depend only weakly on\nthe effective friction coefficient, i.e., the friction angle, at\nleast in the range of values explored by Lube et al. [2004].\nIn the same regime, the final shape of the deposit is also\nfound to depend weakly on the friction coefficient. This\nsensitivity increases with a.\n[62] Numerical experiments confirm the existence of two\ndynamic spreading regimes depending on the initial aspect\nratio a, as observed experimentally. The saturation of the\nnormalized height of the deposit Hf /Ri, as a function of the\nnormalized radius r/Ri, observed experimentally\nis accurately reproduced by the model. For an initial conical\nshape, this saturated value is found to be close to the\neffective friction coefficient. This suggests the need for\nnew experiments to calibrate the angle of effective friction\nof the proposed minimal model, which could be identified\nas the angle of stability of a conical mass suddenly released\nfrom rest.\n[63] The good agreement observed between numerical\nand laboratory experiments for a < 1 strongly suggests that\nin this case, the gravitational spreading involves a flow\nregime characterized by vertical velocity fluctuations which\ncan be averaged out over a vertical length smaller or equal\nto the actual height of the granular material, and that vertical\nacceleration remains small compared to the vertical pressure\ngradient. However, such an agreement becomes more qual-\nitative in the second dynamic regime characterized by large\nvalues of the initial aspect ratio a > 1. Note also that for this\nregime, the final shape of the deposit becomes relatively\nsensitive to the effective friction coefficient. Moreover in\nboth regimes, the experimentally observed arrest phase and\nthe late relaxation process are not reproduced by the\nminimal model used in this study. This suggest that the\nminimal model should be extended to provide a more\nrealistic rheological behavior. The laboratory experiments\nsuggest that both propagation and consolidation phases are\ninvolved in the spreading of the granular mass. In our\nminimal formulation, the model is expressed in terms of\ntotal stresses. This approximation is only valid, for drained",

This is clearly not\nthe case during the arrest phase and the late relaxation\nprocess, suggesting that pore pressure dissipation and ef-\nfective stresses should be taken into account. The model\ncould be extended to include the coupling between a solid\nskeleton and pore fluids, via an approach similar to mixture\ntheories [Pastor et al., 2002; Iverson and Denlinger, 2001],\nin order to take vertical consolidation and pore pressure\ndecrease into account.\n[64] The scaling relations of ~Hf (a) and ~Rf (a), suggested\nby laboratory and numerical experiments, provide a useful\nway of estimating the overun area A for gravitation collapse\nevents both in the case of terrestrial and extraterrestrial\nconditions. Moreover, these experiments show that the time\nneeded for the front to stop scales directly with the charac-\nteristic time of the free fall divided by the effective\ncoefficient of friction m = tan d, and can be recovered from\nthe ~ts(a) scaling. All the numerical results are shown to fall\nwithin the range of the data from deposits of natural events\ndespite the simplicity of the numerical configuration. All\nthese results suggest that classical interpretation of the\neffective friction coefficient in terms of the ratio H/L,\ngenerally advocated for the mobility of geological events,\nis very questionable since this ratio is shown to be depen-\ndent on the aspect ratio of the initial released mass. Such a\ndependence may provide an alternative interpretation of the\nhigh mobility of natural events involving the destabilization\nof large volumes of soil material.",
