        "text": "Present-day overpressure prediction and prediction of past and present hydrocarbon migration flow paths are among the main objectives of \npetroleum system modelling. Both require an accurate description of the interaction between fluid pressure and rock matrix mechanical \nbehavior including compaction and natural fracturing. Only petroleum system simulators can provide quantitative estimates of risk of \noverpressure or cap rock leakage. \n \nA basic assumption made by petroleum system simulators is that basin deformation during geological history is accommodated by vertical \ncompaction, and is controlled by sediment load and fluid pressure according to 1D Terzaghi’s theory. This 1D mechanical model is commonly \nconsidered as satisfying when modelling basins showing low tectonic activity.  \n \nIn the study presented here, we investigate the limits of this hypothesis. We take advantage of a newly developed simulation workflow \ncoupling geo-mechanical computation and petroleum system simulation to investigate how far a generalized mechanical model - instead of the \nusual 1D model - can change our predictions. \n \nThe study focuses on a 2D synthetic model of a passive margin, which is simulated with both a 1D mechanical compaction model and with a \ncoupled generalized hydro- mechanical model. Comparisons of the simulations focus on the development of overpressures and diffuse natural \nfracturing.",
