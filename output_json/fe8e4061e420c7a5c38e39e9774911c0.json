        "text": "Since the appearance of Theoretical Soil Mechanics six decades ago, \ngeotechnical engineering has grown from a barely accepted specialized \narea into an essential major field in civil engineering. Theoretical Soil \nMechanics determined the pattern of this development in no small way, \nby presenting the assumptions and defining the limits of usefulness of \ntheory in dealing with the complex natural materials with which the geo-\ntechnical engineer must work. Because of the departures from reality \ninherent in the application of any theory to a practical problem, simplic-\nity was preferred to complexity, and the discrepancies between the re-\nsults of calculations and reality were discovered and addressed by \nmeans of field observations. \nThe need for simplicity has today been somewhat lessened by the \ncomputer, but the ability to carry out complex calculations nonetheless \nincreases the need for simple checks by means of approximate theories \nwith clearly defined assumptions. Theoretical Soil Mechanics remains a \nrich source book for solutions that emphasize the assumptions and pro-\nvide back-of-the-envelope reality checks. \nTheories concerning the behavior of earthworks, including the classi-\ncal earth-pressure theories of Coulomb and Rankine, abounded long be-\nfore the appearance of this book. Their use led sometimes to realistic \nresults, sometimes to predictions at marked variations from reality. The \ndistribution of the earth pressure with depth against the bracing of tem-\nporary open cuts with vertical sides is a notable example. The discrep-\nancy was the result of the users' failure to recognize the deformation \nconditions implicit in the theories. Even elaborate large-scale model \ntests to investigate the validity of the theories produced conflicting and \nconfusing results, because the significance of the boundary deformation \nconditions was not appreciated. These fundamental aspects of theory \nwere first clearly set forth in a systematic way in this book and opened \nthe door to the intelligent interpretation of field and laboratory observa-\ntions. They are no less significant in today's computer age than when the \nbook first appeared. \nAs Terzaghi himself noted, real soils, being the products of nature, dif-\nfer behaviorally in some respects from the idealized materials consid-\nered in the theories. Terzaghi's decision to emphasize the difference by \ndevoting this book to the behavior of the idealized materials, leaving the",

        "text": "In the fifteen years since the author published his first book on soil \nmechanics interest in this subject has spread over the whole globe and \nboth our theoretical and our practical knowledge of the subject have \nexpanded rapidly. The Proceedings of the First International Conference \non Boil Mechanics (Cambridge 1936) alone contains a greater amount \nof quantitative infonnation regarding soils and foundations than the \nentire engineering literature prior to 1910. \nYet, as in every other field \nof engineering, the first presentation of the theoretical principles has \nbeen followed by a period of transition characterized by a tendency \ntoward indiscriminate application of theory and by unwarranted gener-\nalizations. Hence, when the author began work on a new textbook on \nsoil mechanics he considered it advisable to separate theory completely \nfrom practical application. This volume deals exclusively with the \ntheoretical principles. \nTheoretical soil mechanics is one of the many divisions of applied \nmechanics. In every field of applied mechanics the investigator operates \nwith ideal materials only. The theories of reinforced concrete, for \ninstance, do not deal with real reinforced concrete. They operate with \nan ideal material, whose assumed properties have been derived from \nthose of the real reinforced concrete by a process of radical simplification. \nThis statement also applies to every theory of soil behavior. The mag-\nnitude of the difference between the perfonnance of real soils under field \nconditions and the performance predicted on the basis of theory can \nonly be ascertained by field experience. The contents of this volume \nhas been limited to theories which have stood the test of experience and \nwhich are applicable, under certain conditions and restrictions, to the \napproximate solution of practical problems. \nBesides providing the reader with a working knowledge of useful \nmethods of analysis, theoretical soil mechanics also serves an important \neducational purpose. The radical separation between theory and \napplication makes it easy to impress upon the reader the conditions for \nthe validity of the different mental operations known as theories. Once \nthe reader has grasped, on the basis of the results of the analysis, the \nmanifold factors which determine the behavior of simple, ideal materials \nunder the influence of internal and external forces he will be less likely \nto succumb to the omnipresent danger of unwarranted generalizations \nbased on inadequate data. \nvii",

The properties of real soils and \nthe performance of soils under field conditions will be discussed in a \ncompanion volume. \nFor the author, theoretical soil mechanics never was an end in itself. \nMost of his efforts have been devoted to the digest of field experiences \nand to the development of the technique of the application of our knowl-\nedge of the physical properties of soils to practical problems. Even \nhis theoretical investigations have been made exclusively for the purpose \nof clarifying some practical issues. Therefore this book conspicuously \nlacks the qualities which the author admires in the works of competent \nspecialists in the general field of applied mechanics. Nevertheless he \ncould not evade the task of writing the book himself, because it required \nhis own practical background to assign to each theory its proper place \nin the entire system. \nThe sources from which the subject matter has been collected are listed \nin the bibliography. The approximate methods of computing the bear-\ning capacity of footings in Articles 46 to 49, the earth pressure of sand \non the walls of shafts in Article 74, the critical head of piping in Arti-\ncles 94 to 96, the gas pressure in bubbles and voids in Article 112, and \nthe approximate solutions of the drainage problems given in Articles \n118, 119, and 122 have not previously been published. \nThe first draft for the manuscript was thoroughly studied and com-\nmented upon by Mr. Albert E. Cummings and Dr. Ralph B. Peck. \nTheir comments were so helpful and constructive that they induced \nthe complete revision of several chapters and the partial revision of \nseveral others. The author is also indebted to his wife, Dr. Ruth D. \nTerzaghi, for careful scrutiny of the manuscript in its various stages and \nto Dr. Phil M. Ferguson for valuable suggestions.",

The author \nused these symbols except those for loads and resistances and those for \nsome of the linear dimensions. In the manual an attempt was made to \ntrace a sharp boundary between load (p and P) and resistance (q and Q). \nSince these two quantities are sometimes equal and opposite, the dis-\ncrimination is neither necessary nor useful. \nTherefore the author \nretained the conventional symbols q and Q for external loads and p \nand P or f and F for pressures and forces on inner surfaces such as the \nsurface of contact between a retaining wall and a backfill. The symbols \nfor some of those quantities which appear conspicuously in the diagrams, \nsuch as length or width, have been omitted from the list because rigid \nstandardization of the symbols for such quantities is unnecessary. \nIn the following list the dimensions of the quantities expressed by \nthe symbols are given in cm-gm-sec. \nThey could as well be expressed \nin any other units, for instance in ft-Ib-hr, without changing the expo-\nnents.

Soil mechanics is the application \nof the laws of mechanics and hydraulics to engineering problems dealing \nwith sediments and other unconsolidated accumulations of solid par-\nticles produced by the mechanical and chemical disintegration of rocks, \nregardless of whether or not they contain an admixture of organic \nconstituents. In geology such accumulations are called mantle or \nregolith. The term Boil is reserved for the decomposed upper layer \nwhich supports plants. On the other hand, in civil engineering the \nmaterial which the geologist calls mantle is commonty known as soil or \nearth. The soil of the geologist and agronomist does not receive any \nconsideration in this book, because it can be used neither as a basis for \nstructures nor as a construction material. Since this book deals with \na. branch of civil engineering it is unfortunately necessary to retain the \nambiguous terms soil and earth for material which should appropriately \nbe called mantle. \nSoil mechanics includes (1) theories of behavior of soils under stress, \nbased on radically simplifying assumptions, (2) the investigation of the \nphysical properties of real soils, and (3) the application of our theoretical \nand empirical knowledge of the subject to practical problems.",

When used in \nconnection with the design of a steel or a reinforced concrete structure, \napplied mechanics provides us at the very start with conclusive informa-\ntion, because the data on which the computations are based are relatively \nreliable. On the other hand, the theories of soil mechanics provide us \nonly with working hypotheses, because our knowledge of the average \nphysical properties of the subsoil and of the orientation of the bounda-\nries between the individual strata is always incomplete and often utterly \ninadequate. Nevertheless, from a practical point of view, the working \nhypothesis furnished by soil mechanics is as useful as the theory of \nstructures in other branches of civil engineering.

The bond between the soil particles \nis called cohesion. No definite angle of repose can be assigned to a soil \nwith cohesion, because the steepest slope at which such a soil can stand \ndecreases with increasing height of the slope. Even sand, if it is moist, \nhas some cohesion. \nAB a consequence, the steepest slope at which it \nwill stand decreases with the height of the slope. \nIn spite of the apparent simplicity of their general characteristics \nthe mechanical properties of real sands and clays are so complex that a \nrigorous mathematical analysis of their behavior is impossible. Hence \ntheoretical soil mechanics deals exclusively with imaginary materials \nreferred to as ideal sands and ideal clays whose mechanical properties \nrepresent a simplification of those of real sands and clays. The follow-\ning example may illustrate the difference between the real and the ideal \nsoils. Most real soils are capable of sustaining considerable deformation \nwithout appreciable loss of shearing resistance. In order to simplify \nour theories we assume that the shearing resistance of the ideal soils is \nentirely independent of the degree of deformation.

In order to solve these problems it is sufficient \nto know the stress conditions for the failure of the soil. No consider-\nation need be given to the corresponding state of strain unless there are \ncertain limitations imposed upon the deformation of the soil, such as \nthe limitation due to the incapacity of one part of a lateral support to \nchange its position. Even if such limitations exist, it is sufficient to \nconsider them in a general way without attempting a quantitative \nanalysis of the corresponding strain effects. \nElasticity problems deal with the deformation of the soil due to its \nown weight or due to external forces such as the weight of buildings. \nAll settlement problems belong in this category. In order to solve these \nproblems we must know the relationship between stress and strain for \nthe soil, but the stress conditions for failure do not enter into the analysis. \nIntermediate between these two groups is the problem of determining \nthe conditions of loading and of support required to establish the plastic \nstate at one point of a )nass of soil. In connection with problems of this \ntype, both the elastic properties and the stress conditions for failure must \nbe taken into consideration. The transition from the initial state to \nthe ultimate failure of the soil by plastic flow is known as progressive \nfailure. \nIn nature the voids of every soil are partly or completely filled with \nwater. The water may be in a state of rest or in a state of flow. If it \nis in a state of rest, the methods for solving stability and deformation \nproblems are essentially identical with those for solving similar prob-\nlems in the mechanics of solids in general. On the other hand, if the \nwater percolates through the voids of the soil, the problems cannot be \nsolved without previously determining the state of stress in the water \ncontained in the voids of the soil. In this case we are obliged to com-\nbine the mechanics of solids with applied hydraulics. \n(Chapters XII \nto XV.)",

For \nthese reasons, the data required for making a stability computation \npertaining to clays can at present be obtained only by means of the \nfollowing, purely empirical procedure. We test the clay in the labora-\ntory under conditions of pressure and drainage similar to those under \nwhich the shear failure is likely to occur in the field and we introduce \nthe values c and q, thus obtained into our equations. It is obvious \nthat the success of this procedure depends chiefly on the degree to \nwhich the experimenter has succeeded in imitating the field conditions. \nThe influence of the test conditions on the numerical values c and q, in \nequation 5 (1) will be discussed in a volume on applied soil mechanics. \nIn the following articles the symbol it for the effective stress will be \nused only if it is necessary for preventing misunderstandings.

Accord-\ning to the accepted nomenclature in applied mechanics the normal \nstress on any section which is not acted upon by a shearing stress is \ncalled a principal stress. The section itself represents a principal plane. \nThe normal stress on every vertical section of our specimen is (fll = (fIll. \nThe corresponding shearing stress must also be equal to zero.

Hence the stress (fIl = (fIll also represents a principal stress. \nIf (fII and (fIll are different, the conditions for equilibrium require \nthat the directions of (flJ (fIll and (fIll intersect at right angles. \nWhatever the state of stress may be it is always possible to make \nthrough every point of the body three principal sections which are acted \nupon only by principal stresses.

Then we trace through point P a line \nparallel to aa in Figure 5a. \nIt intersects the line Plat an angle a. \nBy geometry this angle is equal to one half of the angle aAI. Hence \nthe line must intersect the circle of stress at the point a whose \nco-ordinates represent the state of stress on the inclined section aa in \nFigure 5a. \nThis simple relation makes it possible to ascertain in the \ndiagram (Fig. 5b) the position of the point whose co-ordinates represent \nthe stresses on any arbitrary' section by tracing a straight line through \nthe point P parallel to the section under consideration. The point P \nis called the pole of the diagram and is indicated by a double circle. \nThe principle of the procedure can be condensed into the following",

Thus for instance point a represents the state of stress on section \naa. If we select several such points on the circle of stress and trace \nthrough each one of these points a line parallel to the corresponding \nsection in Figure 5a, all the lines thus obtained intersect the circle of \nstress at the same point, the pole P. Hence if we know the orientation \nof the section corresponding to a single point on the circle of stress we \nobtain the pole by tracing through this point a line parallel to the section. \nThe graphic procedures illustrated by Figures 4 and 5 are valid for \nany material and regardless of whether or not the stresses ur and Urn \ninclude a pore-water pressure uw, because no assumption has been \nmade regarding the physical properties of the material under investi-\ngation. \nIn soil mechanics the most important application of the stress circle \nmethod illustrated by Figures 4 and 5 consists in solving the following \nproblem: We know the direction of the extreme principal stresses and \nthe intensity of one of them. We also know, for instance from the \nresults of shear tests, that the earth fails by shear as soon as the shearing \nstresses on any section satisfy Coulomb's equation",

Since the unknown stress O'III is \nassumed to be the smaller principal stress the corresponding circle of \nstress must be located on the left side of point I.

Hence the only circle of stress which satisfies \nthe condition that it represents the state of stress in existence at point \nB at the instant of failure by shear is the circle which is tangent to the \nlines of rupture.

The theory on which the compu-\ntation of the stresses in a state of plastic equilibrium is based is called \nthe theory of plasticity. There are several theories of plasticity, based \non different assumptions regarding the conditions for plastic flow \n(Nadai 1931). These assumptions have been obtained by simplifying \nthe real stress conditions for the plastic flow of the materials subject to \ninvestigation. The theory of plasticity pertaining to soils is based on \nMohr's theory of rupture because we have not yet a substitute which \ndescribes the plastic properties of the soils in a more satisfactory man-\nner. On the basis of Mohr's concept we obtained equations 3,6, and 7, \nwhich represent three different forms of the fundamental equations of \nthe theory of plastic equilibrium in ideal soils with which the following \nchapters deal. The equations have been derived on the assumption, \nstated at the outset, that equation 5(1) is valid not only for the shear \nplane but for any other section through a given point of a mass in a state \nof plastic equilibrium. \nMohr's diagram is nothing but a device for solving graphically some \nof our problems in plasticity on the assumption that Mohr's concept of \nthe stress conditions for failure is justified. This assumption also \nimplies that the cohesion c of the material subject to investigation is a \nconstant of the material. \nIf c in equation 5(1) is equal to zero (cohesionless materials) and if, \nin addition, (f represents an effective normal stress, this assumption is \napproximately correct. The discrepancies which exist between the \nassumption and the mechanical properties of real clays will be described \nin a volume on applied soil mechanics. An analysis of their influence \non the validity of Mohr's diagram and the corresponding equations for \nclays has led to the following conclusions. In spite of the discrepancies, \nequations 3 to 7 are always tolerably reliable. On the other hand, the \ndifference between the real and the computed orientation of the surfaces \nof sliding with reference to the principal planes is always important. \nIn general, if the stresses in the equations or in the diagrams represent \neffective stresses, the error is likely to be less important than the error \nassociated with similar computations involving mixed stresses. \nThe preceding investigations were also based on the tacit assumption \nthat plastic flow, involving a continuous deformation under constant \nstress, has no influence on the values c and tP contained in equation 5 (1). \nThus both the ideal sand and the ideal clay are assumed to be capable",

The \ncircle which represents the state of stress at the instant of active failure \npasses through Z and is tangent to the rupture line OM at point a. \nTo find the pole P A we draw through Z a line parallel to the plane \non which the stress represented by Z acts, i.e., parallel to the base of the \nelement (see Art. 7 and Fig. 5). This plane rises at an angle fJ to the \nhorizontal and the line OZ also rises at an angle fJ to the horizontal. \nTherefore the pole PAis located at the point of intersection between \nthe circle and the line OZ.

The same figure shows that at the depth :1 \nthe states of stress corresponding to these two types of failure are identical.",

If the solution of a problem \nsatisfies the fundamental equations of a general theory, such as the \ntheory of elasticity or of a theory of plasticity, it also satisfies the con-\ndition that the computed state of stress and strain in the interior of the \nbody subject to investigation is compatible with the assumptions re-\ngarding the mechanical properties of the material on which the theory \nis based. However, in connection with a specific problem the computed \nstate of stress and strain must also be compatible with the conditions \nwhich are known in advance to exist along the boundaries of the body \nsubject to investigation. These boundary conditions can be divided \ninto two groups, the boundary stress corulitions and the boundary deforma-\ntion corulitions. They will briefly be called the stress corulitions and the \ndeformation corulitions. \nIn connection with elasticity problems there is seldom any doubt \nregarding the nature of stress conditions, nor can there be any doubt \nregarding the deformation conditions. As an example we consider the \nproblem of computing the state of stress produced by a surcharge q per \nunit of area on a small portion of the upper surface of an elastic layer \nwhose lower surface rests on a rigid base. There is no doubt that the \nsolution must satisfy the condition that the vertical displacement of \nthe base of the elastic layer must everywhere be equal to zero. \nOn the other hand, in connection with plasticity problems of soil \nmechanics, the deformation conditions have seldom received the atten-\ntion which they deserve. As an example of the influence of the deforma-\ntion conditions on the state of stress in a mass of soil on the verge of \nsliding, let us consider the practical applications of the theory of plastic \nequilibrium in semi-infinite cohesionIess masses, described in Article 10. \nIt has been emphasized that the transition of semi-infinite masses from \na state of elastic into a state of plastic equilibrium can only be accom-\nplished by an imaginary process of stretching or compressing the soil \nwhich is without any parallel in the physical world. The states of plastic \nequilibrium produced in soils by engineering operations never extend \nbeyond the boundaries of very narrow zones. In order to apply the",

Hence at depth z the width of the shaded \narea is equal to E • x. \nThe value E depends not only on the type of soil, \non its density, and on the depth z but also on the initial state of stress. \nHence the only general statement which can be made concerning the \nshaded area is that its width must increase from zero at point b to a \nmaximum at point a. For a sand with a uniform density one can assume \nwith crude approximation that E is independent of depth z. On this \nassumption the shaded area is triangular as shown in the figure. For a \ngiven initial state of stress in the sand the value E decreases with increas-\ning density of the sand. As soon as the active state is reached, the \nresultant F of the stresses on the surface be acts at an angle t/J to the \nnormal on be (Fig. 14a). The stress on ab is horizontal and increases \ndirectly with depth, giving a resultant P A which acts at the top of the \nlower third of abo The weight of the soil in the wedge is W. The three \nforces F, W, and P A constitute a set of concurrent forces in equilibrium. \nIf we replace the overstressed soil below and to the right of be by a \nmass of soil in an elastic state of stress, without changing the state of \nstress and deformation within the zone abe, the force F retains both its \ndirection and magnitude. The weight of the soil in the zone abc remains \nunchanged. Hence, if we replace the soil on the left side of ab by an \nartificial support without changing the state of stress and deformation \nwithin the zone abc, the equilibrium of the system requires that the \nsupport furnish the horizontal reaction P A described above. In other \nwords, if the substitutions which we have made do not change the state \nof stress and deformation within the zone abc the forces F, W, and P A \nare identical with those described above. \nIf the soil has been deposited behind an artificial support ab the \npreceding conclusion retains its validity provided the following condi-\ntions are satisfied. First, the presence of the artificial support should \nnot produce any shearing stresses along abo This is the boundary stress",

This conclusion is based on the following \nreasoning. It has been observed that the lateral earth pressure on the \nback of a perfectly rigid, fixed wall is very much greater than the active \nearth pressure. In order to pass into the active Rankine state the soil \nadjoining the wall must undergo a lateral expansion at least as great a8 \nthat required to produce the same change in the state of streBB in the \ntriangular section abc of the semi-infinite mass shown in Figure 14a. \nThis expansion requires the lateral yield of the wall mentioned above. \nThis is the boundary deformation condition. If either one of these two \nconditions is not satisfied, the identification of the backfill of an artificial \nsupport with the section abc in Figure 14a is not justified. It is, for in-\nstance, conceivable that a lateral support is retained at point a in \nFigure 14a while the lower end is capable of yielding far beyond point b. \nOn this condition, the upper part of the bank cannot expand in a hori-\nzontal direction, which prevents this part of the bank from passing into \nan active Rankine state. Yet, if the lower part of the support yields \nfar enough another type of plastic equilibrium will develop. In Chap-\nter V it will be shown that the lateral confinement of the upper part of \nthe supported soil induces arching which increases the lateral pressure \non the upper part of the support and relieves the pressure on the lower \npart. The surface of sliding through the foot of the lateral support is \nstrongly curved and it intersects the surface of the soil at right angles. \nHence, if the upper edge of the lateral support cannot advance into the \nposition indicated by a1 in Figure 14a, neither the shape of the sliding \nwedge nor the orientation of the forces which act on the wedge have \nany resemblance to what is shown in Figure 14a, though all the other \nconditions for the validity of the preceding reasoning, including the \nabsence of shearing stresses on ab (Fig. 14a) may be satisfied. \nFinally, if the wall can yield only to a position intermediate between \nab and alb (Fig. 14a) the conditions for a failure of the earth will nowhere \nbe satisfied, and the unit pressure on ab will have Borne value inter-\nmediate between the unit earth pressure at rest, determined by the \nequation",

Neither \nthe conditions which determine the distribution of the earth pressure \non the timbering of cuts nor those which determine the intensity and \nthe distribution of the earth pressure on tunnel tubes have any re-\nsemblance to the fundamental conditions for the validity of Rankine's \ntheory and its generalizations. \nIn order to prevent the flagrant mis-\napplication of theories of this or a similar type, each of the following \ntheoretical investigations will be preceded by a complete statement of \nthe conditions and assumptions. Every one of the theories contained \nin the following chapters of this volume can be relied upon to give \nsufficiently accurate results when applied to practical cases provided \nthe field conditions correspond at least approximately to the stated \nconditions and assumptions. Otherwise the theory is inapplicable \nregardless of how sound it may be within the range of its validity. \n14. Rankine's theory of earth pr~lisure on retaining walls. \nThe \nbest known application of the principles explained in the preceding \narticle is Rankine's theory of the earth pressure on retaining walls. \nIf a retaining wall yields, the backfill of the wall expands in a horizontal \ndirection, whereupon the lateral pressure exerted by the soil on the \nback of the wall gradually decreases and approaches a lower limiting \nvalue, which is called the active earth pressure. On the other hand, if \nwe force the wall in a horizontal direction towards the backfill, thus \ncompressing the soil in a horizontal direction, the resistance of the soil \nincreases until it assumes an upper limiting value, the passive earth \npressure. When the movement of the wall brings about either of these \ntwo limiting values, the soil fails by plastic flow. \nTo illustrate the \nessential characteristics and defects of Rankine's theory we compute \nthe earth pressure exerted by a cohesionless backfill with a horizontal \nsurface on the vertical back of an artificial support with a height H. \nThe shearing resistance of the soil is determined by the equation",

The following paragraphs contain a summary of the results \nof the investigations of Reissner and of other workers in this field. \nOn \naccount of the elementary treatment of the subject, some of the state-\nments must be accepted without rigorous proof. \nFigure 14c is a vertical section through a semi-infinite mass of ideal \nsand. When this mass is deformed by stretching it uniformly in a hori-\nzontal direction the material passes through the active Rankine state \nand fails along two sets of plane surfaces of sliding such as those on the \nright-hand side of the line aD.

During this process \nthe shearing stresses on every plane section through a located between \nthe diaphragm and aD will increase. However, on the surface of \nsliding aD the shearing stresses remain unchanged, because the mass \nof sand located above aD was from the very outset on the verge of sliding \nalong aD in a downward direction. \nThe resultant P A of the lateral pressure on any part of the diaphragm \nslopes at an angle 8 to the horizontal, as indicated in the fi~re.",

If a wall with a rough back yields in such a manner \nthat the deformation of the wedge-shaped mass of sand adjoining the \nwall is identical with that of the sand located within the zone abe in \nFigure 14e, the sand fails along a surface of sliding similar to be (Fig. \n14e) and the distribution of the earth pressure on the back of the wall \nwill be hydrostatic. The transition of the semi-infinite mass from its \ninitial state into a state of active plastic equilibrium requires that the \nhorizontal stretching of the mass exceed in every point of the mass a \ncertain lower limiting value per unit of length which depends on the \nelastic properties of the sand and on the initial state of stress. The \ncorresponding horizontal deformation of the sand located within the \nzone abe (Fig. 14e) is indicated by the shaded area. Any deformation \nin excess of that represented by the shaded area has no influence on \nthe state of stress in the sand. Hence, if the wall yields into any position \nbeyond alb, the sand fads by sliding along the surface be (Fig. 14c) and \nthe distribution of the earth pressure on ab will be hydrostatic. On the \nother hand, if the wall yields, for instance, by tilting around the upper \nedge a, the shape of the surface of sliding must be different from be and \nthe distribution of the earth pressure depends on the type of yield. \nThe preceding reasoning can be applied without any modification to \na backfill acted upon by negative wall friction and to the passive earth \npressure. Figure 141 shows the shear pattern for active plastic equi-\nlibrium and negative wall friction. \nIf a semi-infinite mass of sand, located on both sides of a rough \nstationary diaphragm, is transferred by horizontal compression into a \nstate of passive plastic equilibrium, the shear pattern shown in Figure \n14e is obtained. Since the lateral compression causes the sand to rise \nin a vertical direction while the diaphragm remains stationary, the \nresultant passive earth pressure deviates from its normal component in \nan upward direction. The corresponding angle of wall friction 5 is \ncalled positive. The influence of the wall friction on the state of stress \nin the sand does not extend beyond the Rankine surface aD through the \nupper rim of the diaphragm, because at any value of 5 the sand located \nabove aD is on the verge of sliding along aD in an upward direction. \nWithin the wedge-shaped zone aBD both surfaces of sliding are curved. \nTheir shape has been investigated by Jaky (1938) and Ohde (1938). \nThe equation for each set can be written in the form T = TO/(O), wherein",

Therefore the zone of plastic \nequilibrium must also be symmetrical with reference to this plane. \nHence the lower boundary of the zone of plastic equilibrium will be as \nshown in the figure by the line edcdlel. \nThe preceding investigation was based on the assumption that the \nunit weight of the loaded material is equal to zero. In reality there is \nno weightless material. The weight of the material complicates the \nsituation very considerably. At given values of c and q, it increases \nthe critical load and it changes the shape of the surfaces of sliding \nwithin both the active Rankine zone and the zone of radial shear. Thus \nfor instance in the zone of radial shear the radial lines of shear are not \nstraight as shown in Figure I5a, but curved (Reissner 1924). \nThe problem of computing the critical load on the assumption that",

For any pressure P smaller than a llritical value P p the \ncolumns strictly obey Hooke's law. After the pressure on a column \nhas become equal to P p a further increase of the applied load Q produces \nin the column a state of plastic flow at constant pressure. If this flow \ndoes not relieve the pressure on the column the system fails. \nHence \nif the load Q on the beam is increased, the system passes in succession \nthrough three stages. In the first stage the pressure on each one of \nthe three columns is smaller than P p. In this stage an increase of the \nload merely produces an elastic shortening of the columns and the \nsystem is in a state of elastic equilibrium. The second stage begins as \nsoon as the load on one of the columns becomes equal to Pp. \nAny \nfurther increase of the load Q must be carried by the elastic action of the \ntwo other columns while the load on the third column remains equal \nto load P p. \nThis is the state of plastic-elastic equilibrium. It con-\ntinues to exist until the load on a second column becomes equal to P p. \nA further increase of the load Q causes a continuous plastic shortening \nof both of the columns at constant load. This condition constitutes \nfailure. \nHence the load Qmal< required to increase the load on two \ncolumns to Pp is the greatest load the system can carry. For Q = Qm .. ,. \nthe system is in a state of plastic equilibrium. \nIn the elastic stage the ratio piE of the unit load p = P / A on a. \ncolumn to the corresponding unit shortening E of the column is called \nYoung's modulus E.

The \nfinal equations obtained by rigorously solving other problems are so \ncumbersome that they are unfit for practical use. Therefore, in prac-\ntice, we depend to a great extent on simplified solutions. \nIn connection with elasticity problems, the efforts to obtain simplified \nsolutions have led to such theories as those involving a coefficient of \nsubgrade reaction (Chapter XVI). According to the concept of sub-\ngrade reaction the soil under load behaves like a bed of uniformly spaced \nsprings with uniform stiffness. The error associated with such an \nassumption can be very important. Far more accurate are the simpli-\nfied theories dealing with the conditions for equilibrium of a mass of soil \nlocated above a potential surface of sliding. They are commonly \nreferred to as earth-pressure theories and theories of the stability of \nslopes. \nThe rigorous solutions of most of the problems in these categories are \nvery complicated. Hence there is an urgent need for simplified pro-\ncedures. These procedures consist in replacing the real surface of \nsliding by an imaginary one with a simple equation. The position of \nthe surface of sliding within the soil must be such that the force required \nto prevent a slip along the surface should be a maximum. Comparison \nof the results thus obtained with rigorous solutions has shown that the \nerror due to simplifying the shape of the surface of sliding is often insig-\nnificant. The best-known method of this type is Coulomb's theory of \nthe active earth pressure on retaining walls, based on a substitution of \na plane surface of sliding for the curved one shown in Figure 14c. The \ntheoretical error due to this substitution is not in excess of 5 per cent.",

        "text": "In connection with the practical application of soil mechanics the importance of \nsimplicity cannot be overemphasized, provided the simplicity is not achieved at the \nprice of ignoring the influence of vital factors. The necessity for simplicity is due \nto the nature of the soils. Since there are no perfectly homogeneous soils and since \nthe mechanical properties of real soils are complicated, all the theories of soil mechan-\nics combined represent no more than a small step toward grasping the complex phe-\nnomena subject to investigation. As a consequence, in every field of applied soil \nmechanics the most important operation consists not in obtaining a rigorous solution \nbut in ascertaining the influence of various possible deviations of the real conditions \nfrom the assumed ones. This can be done only on the basis of simple equations which \ninform us at a glance of the relative weight of the different factors which enter into \nthe problem. Most rigorous solutions are by far too complicated to serve this vital \npurpose. The principal value of these solutions is their ability to show the im-\nportance of the theoretical errors involved in the results of simplified analysis. In \nthis connection the rigorous solutions are of inestimable value. However, after a \ncomplicated rigorous solution has rendered this service it is not likely to be of further \nuse unless the results are presented in the form of tables or graphs. The ability to \nobtain rigorous solutions is not a prerequisite for successful work in the field of soil \nmechanics. For both the research man and the practicing engineer it is sufficient \nto know the general procedure by means of which the rigorous solutions are ob-\ntained. The rigorous solution of the problems should be left to professional mathe-\nmaticians. For the same reason only the Simplified methods will be discussed in this \nbook. Wherever it is necessary or advisable to refer to rigorous solutions, only the \nresults will be presented.",

If one part of the support of a mass of soil yield \nwhile the remainder stays in place the soil adjoining the yielding part \nmoves out of its original position between adjacent stationary masses \nof soil. The relative movement within the soil is opposed by a shearing \nresistance within the zone of contact between the yielding and the sta-\ntionary masses. Since the shearing resistance tends to keep the yielding \nmass in its original position, it reduces the pressure on the yielding part \nof the support and increases the pressure on the adjoining stationary \npart. This transfer of pressure from a yielding mass of soil onto ad-\njoining stationary parts is commonly called the arching effect, and the \nsoil is said to arch over the yielding part of the support. Arching also \ntakes place if one part of a yielding support moves out more than the \nadjoining parts. \nArching is one of the most universal phenomena encountered in soils \nboth in the field and in the laboratory. Since arching is maintained \nsolely by shearing stresses in the soil, it is no less permanent than any \nother state of stress in the soil which depends on the existence of shearing \nstresses, such as the state of stress beneath the footing of a column. \nFor instance, if no permanent shearing stresses were possible in a sand, \nfootings on sand would settle indefinitely. On the other hand, every \nexternal influence which causes a supplementary settlement of a footing \nor an additional outward movement of a retaining wall under unchanged \nstatic forces must also be expected to reduce the intensity of existing \narching effects. Vibrations are the most important influence of this \nsort. \nIn ·the following article two typical cases will be investigated, viz., \narching in an ideal sand due to the local yield of a horizontal support \nand arching in the sand adjoining a vertical support whose lower part \nyields in an outward direction.",

In the vicinity \nof the surface all the sand grains move vertically downward. This has \nbeen demonstrated repeatedly by time-exposure photographs. Such a \nmovement is conceivable only if the surfaces of sliding intersect the hori-\nzontal surface of the sand at right angles. \nWhen the failure occurs a \ntroughlike depression appears on the surface of the sand as indicated in \nFigure 17 a. The slope of each side of the depression is greatest where \nit intersects the surface of sliding. The distance between these steepest \nparts of the trough can be measured. It has been found that it is always \ngreater than the width of the yielding strip. Hence, the surfaces of \nsliding must have a shape similar to that indicated in Figure 17a by the \nlines ac and bd. \nThe problem of deriving the equations of the surfaces \nof sliding ac and bd has not yet been solved. \nHowever, experiments \n(Vollmy 1937) suggest that the average slope angle of these surfaces \ndecreases from almost 90\n0 for low values of D/2B to values approach-\ning 45\n0 + ,p/2 for very high values of D/2B. \nThe vertical pressure on the lower part of the mass of sand located \nbetween the two surfaces of sliding, ac and bd in Figure 17a, is equal to \nthe weight of the upper part reduced by the vertical component of the \nfrictional resistance which acts on the adjoining surfaces of sliding. \nThis transfer of part of the weight of the sand located above the yielding \nstrip onto the adjoining masses of sand constitutes the arching effect. \nThe preceding reasoning can also be applied to the analysis of the \narching effect produced in a mass of sand by the lateral yield of the \nlower part of a vertical support. In Figure 17 c the lateral support is \nrepresented by abo \nThe surface of the sand is horizontal and the sup-\nport yields by tilting around its upper edge. After the support has \nyielded sufficiently, a shear failure occurs in the sand along a surface \nof sliding bd which extends from the foot b of the support to the surface \nof the sand. The stationary position of the upper edge, a, of the lateral \nsupport prevents a lateral expansion of the upper part of the sliding \nwedge. \nTherefore the sand grains located in the upper part of the \nwedge can move only in a downward direction. Hence the surface of \nsliding intersects the horizontal surface of the sand at d at right angles. \nThe corresponding subsidence of the surface of the sliding wedge is \nindicated in the figure by a dashed line.",

Although Poncelet's method is better \nknown than any of the others, the methods of Culmann and Engesser \nare preferable for practical purposes because they do not make it neces-\nsary to burden the memory with special rules. \n24. \nCulmann's graphical solution.

Since all these \nmethods are based on the simplifying assumption that the surfaces of \nsliding are plane, they are far from being rigorous. \nNevertheless they \nare rather cumbersome. For practical purposes simpler methods have \nbeen devised which give approximately the same results. Considering \nthe nature of the basic assumptions, it appears doubtful whether the \nelaborate procedures are more reliable than the simple ones. \nThe validity of equation 2 is limited by the condition that every part \nof the mass of soil located within the sliding wedge must be in a state of \nplastic equilibrium. If the deformation conditions are such that the \nslip occurs while part of the sliding wedge is still in a state of elastic \nequilibrium, equation 2 loses its validity and neither of the procedures \ndescribed before can be used for determining the position of the point \nof application of the earth pressure. This is illustrated by Figure 22e, \nwhich shows a vertical bank whose lateral support yields by tilting about \nits upper edge a. \nThe fixed position of a prevents the upper part of \nthe sliding wedge from passing into a state of plastic equilibrium. As \nexplained in Article 20, failure occurs along a curved surface of sliding \nbe which intersects the surface of the backfill at right angles and the \nearth pressure on the support shown in Figure 22e is not identical with \nthat on the back of the retaining wall shown in Figure 22a. \nTherefore \nit will be designated by another symbol, PM instead of PAn' In \nArticle 67 it will be shown that the earth pressure Pan can be expressed \nby an equation",

Figure 30 shows convenient methods of representing \ngraphically the relation between the hydrostatic pressure ratio and the \nvalues of c/J and 5. \nIn Figure 30a the values of KA are plotted on rays \nthrough a zero point. The angle between the rays and the horizontal \naxis is equal to the angle of wall friction 5, and the values of c/J are \ninscribed on the curves which represent the relation between KA and \n5 (Syffert, 1929). In Figure 30b the hydrostatic pressure ratio KA \nhas been plotted against the angle of wall friction 5. \nBoth diagrams \nreveal at a glance the importance of the influence of the angle of wall \nfriction on the intensity of the earth pressure.",

        "text": "35. \nPassive earth pressure in engineering practice. \nIn the broad-\nest sense the term passive earth pressure indicates the resistance of the \nsoil against forces which tend to displace it. In engineering practice \nthe passive earth pressure is frequently utilized to provide a support for \nstructures such as retaining walls or bulkheads which are acted upon by \nhorizontal or inclined forces. The retaining wall shown in Figure 19 \ndepends partly on the passive pressure of the soil located on the left \nside of the face de to prevent failure by sliding along its base bd. The \nequilibrium of the bulkhead shown in Figure 63 is maintained solely by \nthe lateral resistance of the soil on the left side of the face bd. The \nbody which tends to displace the soil is called the seat of the thrust and \nthe surface of contact between this body and the earth represents the \ncontact face. \nThe passive earth pressure of the soil is also utilized when a building \nis supported on footings. If the load on a footing exceeds the ultimate \nbearing capacity of the soil, a wedge-shaped body of soil such as the \nbody abc in Figure 15b moves together with the footing in a downward \ndirection. It may be in a state of plastic or of elastic equilibrium. In \neither state the body abc is deformed without being displaced. On the \nother hand the soil adjoining the inclined lower boundaries of this body, \nac and be in Figure 15b, is shoved out of the ground. This event cannot \noccur unless the pressure which acts on the soil along ac and be is \ngreater than the passive earth pressure. In this case the seat of the \nthrust is represented by the wedge-shaped body of soil abc and the \ncontact faces are represented by two surfaces of sliding which are located \nentirely within the soil. \n36. \nAssumptions and conditions. \nThe following computations are \nbased on the assumption that the soil is isotropic and homogeneous and \nthat the deformation of the soil occurs only parallel to a vertical section \nat right angles to the contact face. It is further assumed that the \ncontact face advances under the influence of the thrust into a position \nwhich is located entirely beyond the boundary alb of the shaded area \nin Figure 14e. This area represents the minimum lateral compression \nwhich is required to transfer the soil adjoining the contact face from its",

If either \ncor q is greater than zero the passive earth pressure can be determined \nby two successive operations. The first one is based on the assumption \nthat the unit weight 'Y of the soil is equal to zero. Thus we obtain the \ncomponent P~ of the earth pressure.

It \nrequires a repetition of the computation for several circles, each of \nwhich passes through b. \nThe values of Ph P 2, Pa, etc., thus obtained \nare plotted as ordinates above the line representing the horizontal \nsurface of the ground.",

In engineering practice the load is transmitted to the \nbearing area by means of footings or piers. Figure 36a is a section \nthrough a footing. \nThe length of a continuous footing is great compared \nto its width 2B whereas that of a spread footing is approximately equal \nto the width. A pier (Fig. 36b) is a cylindrical or a prismatic body of \nmasonry whose horizontal dimensions are small compared to the depth \nD I of its base below the surface. The lower end of some piers is given the \nshape of a truncated cone whose base has a greater area than the section \nthrough the pier (belled-out caisson pier). \nIn the following investigations it is a.ssumed that the soil is homo-\ngeneous from the surface to a depth which is far below the level of the \nbase of the footings or piers. \n44. Failure by local and by general shear. Before the load on a \nfooting is applied the soil located beneath the level of the base of the \nfooting is in a state of elastic equilibrium. The corresponding state of \nstress will be described in Chapter XVII. When the load on the footing \nis increased beyond a certain critical value, the soil gradually passes \ninto a state of plastic equilibrium. During this process of transition \nboth the distribution of the soil reactions over the base of the footing \nand the orientation of the principal stresses in the soil beneath the \nfootings change. The transition starts at the outer edges of the base \nand spreads as indicated in Figure 123c for a continuous footing which \nrests on the horizontal surface of a homogeneous mass of sand and in \nFigure 123d for a footing whose base is located at some depth beneath \nthe surface. H the mechanical properties of the soil are such that \nthe strain which precedes the failure of the soil by plastic flow is very \nsmall the footing does not sink into the ground until a state of plastic \nequilibrium similar to that illustrated by Figure 15b has been reached. \nThe corresponding relation between load and settlement is shown by \nthe solid curve C1 in Figure 36c.

On account \nof the existence of this resistance against lateral spreading the soil \nlocated immediately beneath the base of the footing remains perma-\nnently in a state of elastic equilibrium and the soil located within the \ncentral zone behaves as if it were a part of the sinking footing. \nThe \ndepth of this wedge-shaped body of soil remains practically unchanged. \nYet the footing sinks. This process is only conceivable if the soil \nlocated just below point d moves vertically downward. This type of \nmovement requires that the surface of sliding de through point d should \nstart from a vertical tangent. The boundary ad of the zone of radial \nshear, ade, is also a surface of sliding. According to Article 7 the \npotential surfaces of sliding in an ideal plastic material intersect each \nother in every point of the zone of plastic equilibrium at an angle of \n90° -,p. Therefore the boundary ad (Fig. 37b) must rise at an angle \n,p to the horizontal, provided the friction and adhesion between the soil \nand the base of the footing suffice to prevent a sliding motion at the base. \nThe right-hand side of this figure shows the deformation associated with \nthe sinking of the footing. \nThe sharp rise of the soil on both sides of \nthe base of the footing has given rise to various speculations, and it has \nbeen referred to as edge action. It is nothing else but the visible mani-\nfestation of the existence of two zones of radial shear. \nTrial computations have shown that the angle of base friction re-\nquired to produce the state of plastic flow illustrated by Figure 37b is \nvery much smaller than the angle of shearing resistance of the sup-\nporting soil. Hence, the lower boundary of the central zone beneath \nfootings can always be assumed to rise at an angle ,p to the horizontal. \nHowever, theoretically, the slope angle of these boundaries may have \nany value 1/1 intermediate between ,p and 45° + ,p/2.",

For\", = 34° we obtained bit (Fig. 38a) = 8.5B, bf = 7.0B and b!2 = \n5.5B. The corresponding values for\", = 38° are bit = ll.5B, bf = 8.7B, and b!2 = \n7.1B. These figures show that the three surfaces of sliding indicated in Figure 38a \nare very different. Nevertheless it was found that the load QD required to produce \na shear failure on def is less than 10 per cent greater than the sum of the loads Qq \nand Q\"f required to produce a failure on the surfaces deJ/l and de2!2 respectively.",

Equa-\ntion 5 is based on the law which governs the relation between stress and \nstrain under static conditions. This law is not valid for deformation \nunder impact. The equation also fails to include the loss of energy \ndue to the deformation of the soil. The Newtonian equation 7 for \nthe loss of energy due to impact is valid only for the impact between \nbodies which are not subject to an external restraint. Newton himself \nwarned against the application of his theory to problems involving for \ninstance the impact produced by \"the stroke of a hammer\" (Newton \n1726). Equation 9 contains both the Newtonian impact loss and the \nlosses due to elastic deformation. Newton's theory takes into con-\nsideration all the losses of energy including those due to the elastic \ndeformation of the colliding bodies. \nThis fact suffices to invalidate \nequation 9 regardless of whether or not the Newtonian theory of impact \napplies to the problem.",

The dynamic resistance, \nor the resistance of the earth to rapid penetration of the pile produced \nby the blow of a falling hammer, is by no means necessarily identical \nwith the static load required to produce a very slow penetration of the \npile. This is due to the following reasons. The rapid penetration of the \npoint of the pile into the soil is resisted not only by static friction and \ncohesion but also by the viscosity of the soil, which is comparable to the \nviscous resistance of liquids against rapid displacement. On the other \nhand a rapid succession of blows on the head of the pile loosens the grip \nof the soil on the sides of the pile. In extreme cases the operation of \npile driving is likely to eliminate the skin friction almost completely as \nlong as the pile driving lasts and for some time thereafter. \nIn connection with the design of pile foundations we are interested \nonly in the static bearing capacity of the piles. Hence if we should suc-\nceed in obtaining reliable information on the dynamic pile driving \nresistance we would still face the task of investigating by systematic field \ntests the relation between the dynamic and the static bearing capacity \nunder different soil conditions. Until that time the dynamic pile formulas \nwill continue to serve only as \"a yardstick to help the engineer \nto get reasonably safe and uniform results over the entire job\" (Cum-\nmings 1940). However, since all the existing pile formulas are funda-\nmentally deficient, it is usually preferable to use as a yardstick empirical",

In reality \nthe surface of sliding ifl smooth, as indicated in both figures by the dash-\ndotted line a2g. \nFigure 41a represents a slope before and after failure. \nPrior to \nthe failure the soil located within the shaded area is in a state of tension \nand the failure of a slope is always preceded by the appearance of \ntension cracks. The failure occurs by sliding along a curved surface of \nsliding which passes through the lower edge of the slope. The slide \ninvolves a stretching of the upper part of the sliding mass in the direction \nof the slope and a compression of the lower part in the same direction. \nThe corresponding shear pattern is represented in Figure 41b. In the \nlowest part of the sliding mass the shear pattern is similar to that shown \non the left-hand side of the vertical section TS in Figure 13a (passive \nfailure), and in the uppemiost part it has some resemblance to that \nshown on the right-hand side of rs (active failure). The zone of tran-\nsition between these two shear patterns is comparable to the zone of \nradial shear which separates the active and the passive Rankine zones \nin Figure 15a. \nAn inclined slope can also fail on account of inadequate bearing capac-\nity of its base, as indicated in Figure 41c for a material whose angle of \nshearing resistance cp is equal to zero. The question whether the failure \nof a bank will be a slope or a base failure can only be decided on the \nbasis of the results of a stability computation. In order to simplify \nthe investigation we replace the surface of sliding through the lower \nedge b of the slope (slope failure) by an arc of a circle with a radius Tt, \nwhose center is located at Ot, and the composite surface of sliding associ-\nated with a base failure by an arc of a circle with a radius T2 whose \ncenter is located at O2• \nCircles through the toe b are called toe circles in \ncontrast to midpoint circles, which intersect the lower horizontal surface \nof the ground at some distance from the toe. The cohesion required \nto prevent a slip along any arbitrary toe circle is the required cohesion \ncr , and the corresponding value for an arbitrary midpoint circle is \nthe required cohesion Crm• A slope failure occurs along that toe circle \nfor which Cr, is a maximum Ceh and a base failure occurs along that \nmidpoint circle for which Crm is a maximum Cem• These two circles will \nbe called the critical toe circle and the critical midpoint circle respectively. \nThe critical toe circle can be compared to the surface of sliding in the",

First we consider the conditions \nfor the stability of vertical banks, because they are similar to those \nfor the stability of the backfill of a retaining wall. Then we solve in \nsuccession the following problems: (a) computation of the critical co-\nhesion for plane inclined slopes; (b) computation of the critical \ncohesion for an uneven slope on a stratified mass of soil; and (c) compu-\ntation of the factor of safety of a given slope with respect to sliding. \nOn account of the important influence of the angle of shearing resist-\nance cp on the type of failure of a slope (slope or base failure), these \nproblems will first be solved on the assumption that cp = 0 (Arts. 58 \nand 59) and then on the assumption that cp > 0 (Arts. 60 and 61). \nWhen dealing with these problems the existence of tension cracks will \nbe disregarded. The influence of tension cracks on the stability of \ninclined slopes will be discussed in Article 62. \n57. Critical height of vertical banks. \nThe uppermost part of the \nsoil adjoining a slope is in a state of tension, provided the slope angle is \ngreater than the angle of shearing resistance cp in Coulomb's equation. \nThe critical height of a slope is the maximum height which the slope \ncan have before the state of tension is relieved by the formation of \ntension cracks. \nIn the following computation of the critical height of vertical slopes \nit is assumed that the failure occurs along a surface of sliding through \nthe lower edge of the bank (slope failure). Subsequently it will be \nshown that this assumption is justified for any value of cpo \nThe shear-\ning resistance of the earth is determined by Coulomb's equation",

        "text": "This investigation must be repeated for different circles. \nThe factor \nof safety of the slope is equal to the smallest value of G. thus obtained. \nThe procedure is entirely one of trial and error. \nThe preceding method of investigating the stability of slopes can \nalso be used if a bank is supported by a structure such as a retaining wall. \nFigure 46c is a section through a retaining wall with a height H, sup-\nporting a vertical bank of soft homogeneous clay. The clay rests at a \ndepth D = H on a hard stratum. Hence the depth factor nD is 2. \nIf the retaining wall is strong enough to withstand the lateral earth \npressure P A without tilting or sliding, there is no danger of a slope \nfailure. \nHence only the possibility of a base failure needs to be con-\nsidered. For the purpose of a rough estimate the difference between the \nunit weight of the concrete and that of the clay can be disregarded. If \nthe two unit weights are equal, the stability conditions of the retaining \nwall are identical with those for an unsupported slope ab with respect to \na base failure beneath such a slope. Since the depth factor nD is equal \nto 2.0, the stability factors for failures along midpoint circles are deter-\nmined by the curve nD = 2 in Figure 45a. If we continue this curve \ntoward the left until it intersects the left-hand boundary of the diagram \n(not shown in the figure) we find that the stability factor for a slope \nangle fJ = 80\n0 is equal to 5.60. \nFor the corresponding critical height Ho \nof such a slope we obtain from equation 58(4)",

For slopes as steep as 42° the danger of a base \nfailure does not exist, and if the earth rests at 8 very shallow depth \nbelow the foot of the slope on a firm stratum, the safety requirement is \nsatisfied even for a slightly steeper slope. Hence if the sides of the cut \nare made at an angle 42° to the horizontal, the safety requirement is \nsatisfied regardless of the value of the depth factor nD. On the other \nhand, if cp = 0 (Art. 59) the admissible slope angle ranges between \n33° for nD = 1 and 17aaO' for nD = 1.5. This example illustrates the \ndecisive influence even of a small angle of shearing resistance on sta-\nbility. This influence is chiefly due to the fact that the angle of shearing \nresistance required to eliminate the danger of 8 base failure beneath \nslopes with a slope angle of more than about 20° is extremely small. \nA slight increase of the cohesion with depth has a similar effect. Hence, \nif we experience a base failure in a cut in soft clay we know that the \ncohesion did not materially increase with depth and that the angle of \nshearing resistance did not exceed a few degrees. \nFigure 49a is a section through an uneven slope on a sandy clay \nwhose cohesion varies with depth.

If the base of a slope contains \nlayers of clay which are very much softer than the other strata, the sur-\nface of sliding is likely to consist of several sections joining each other \nat obtuse angles. In such a case no continuous curve can be substituted \nfor the entire surface of sliding without the risk of a grave error on the \nunsafe side. Furthermore no slide along a broken surface is conceivable \nwithout plastic flow within at least one section of the sliding mass, \nbecause the movement along a broken surface involves a radical defor-\nmation of the superimposed material. On account of these complica-\ntions the problem of estimating the degree of stability of the fill cannot \nbe solved without taking into consideration the forces which act in the \ninterior of the mass of soil located above the potential surface of slid-\ning. These forces are indicated in Figure 51 which represents a sec-\ntion through a sand dam with a clay core prior to filling the reservoir. \nThe dam rests on a sand stratum which contains a thin bed of clay. \nEven symmetrical dams slide toward one side only and the orientation \nof the slide with reference to the plane of symmetry depends on accidental \nfactors. If the dam shown in Figure 51 fails, the slip will occur along \na composite surface of sliding such as abde. \nIn the right-hand part of \nthe sliding mass, corresponding to the area dlde, active failure is to be \nexpected because within this part the earth is merely under the influence \nof its own weight.

Nevertheless, if on the basis of this assumption we compute the \nactive earth pressure for n\" = 1/3 and 8 = 0 we find that the error is always con-\nsiderably smaller than 10 per cent. With increasing values of n\" the percentage \nerror decreases rapidly. For n\" = 1/2 the spiral method for computing the earth \npressure on the timbering in cuts is at least as accurate as Coulomb's method for \ncomputing the earth pressure on retaining walls.",

Figure 57 a shows 6. section through a \nbed of sand in which a tunnel is being constructed between the hori-\nzontal surface of the bed and the water table. The r.ohesion of the \nBand is assumed to be not in excess of the feeble -bond produced by a \ntrace of moisture. Yet from experience we know that this trace of \ncohesion is sufficient to maintain the working face in small drifts with-\nout lateral support. Part of the yield of the sand toward the tunnel \noccurs while the working face passes the section shown in the figure and \nthe remainder takes place after the timbering has been constructed. \nOwing to the imperfect fit of the timbers at the joints and the com-\npressibility of the supports of the footings of the vertical posts, the \nyield of the timbering is usually sufficient to reduce the pressure of the \nsand on the timbering almost to the value corresponding to the state \nof incipient shear failure in the sand. This state is similar to the state \nof stress in a mass of sand above a yielding strip. The sand adjoining \nthe sides of the tunnel also subsides on account of the yield of its lateral \nsupport. The inclined boundaries of the zone of subsidence rise at \nan angle of about 45° + r/>/2. \nTherefore, at the level of the roof of the \ntunnel, the width of the yielding strip is approximately equal to",

The results of such an investigation have shown that the factor \nof safety with respect to heaving of the bottom of a tunnel through \nsand is always adequate provided the deepest point of the potential \nsurface of sliding is located above the water table. \n71. \nApplication of Rankine's theory to the computation of the pres-\nsure of sand on the lining of tunnels. \nPrior to the construction of a \ntunnel a mass of sand with a horizontal surface is laterally confined \nand the ratio between the horizontal and the vertical pressure is equal \nto the coefficient of earth pressure at rest Ko. In order to establish the \nactive Rankine state, the sand must be allowed to expand laterally \nover the full width and depth of the deposit through a certain mini-\nmum diJtance per unit of width, which depends essentially on the \ndensity of the sand. In contrast to this fundamental requirement of \nRankine's earth pressure theory the lateral expansion of the sand pro-\nduced by the tunneling ·operations does not extend beyond narrow \nzones located on both sides of the tunnel. Beyond these zones the \nhorizontal strain is practically equal to zero. This type of deformation \nis incompatible with Rankine's theory. There is, however, one ex-\nception to this general rule. It involves the pressure of the sand on the \ntimbering of a tunnel at a shallow depth beneath a slope which rises \nat an angle equal to or slightly smaller than the angle of internal friction \nof the sand. To a depth not in excess of a small fraction of the total \nheight of the slope, the sand is on the verge of active failure before the \nconstruction of the tunnel is started. This state is identical with the \nactive Rankine state illustrated by Figures 9b and 9c. For a slope \nangle fJ = rp one set of potential surfaces of sliding is parallel to the \nslope and the other set is vertical. Since the sand was already in a state \nof plastic equilibrium before construction was started, the timbering in \nthe tunnel can do no more than maintain this state. Hence the earth \npressure on the upper part of the support is approximately identical \nwith the active Rankine pressure. For example, if the section through \nthe tunnel has the shape shown in Figure 58, the normal pressures on \nthe section abc of the extrados can be estimated by means of Rankine's \ntheory, using Mohr's diagram. In the sand adjoining this section the \nprincipal stresses (TI and (TIrr are oriented as shown in the figure by \narrows. During the construction operations the stress in the sand at",

State oE stress in the vicinity oE drill holes. \nIn dealing with \nproblems concerning the plastic equilibrium of soil in the vicinity of \ncylindrical holes, a distinction must be made between small holes such \nas drill holes and large holes such as shafts. In contrast to a drill hole, \nthe diameter of which does not exceed a few inches, a shaft is an ex-\ncavation the width of which is at least several feet. \nWhen a small hole is drilled in a deposit of cohesive soil, the walls of \nthe hole may stand without any lateral support. Yet, when a shaft \nhaving a diameter of 10 feet is excavated in the same soil, the walls of \nthe shaft may fail unless supported by timbering. The following \nanalysis deals with the stress conditions which are likely to exist in the \nvicinity of small holes. The term cylindrical section will be used ex-\nclusively for sections whose axis coincides with the center line of the hole. \nLet",

If the diam-\neter of the hole does not exceed a few inches these conditions are almost \nsatisfied even if the radial stresses O'rO at the walls of the hole are very \nsmall. Therefore, the results of the analysis agree with experience with \ndrill holes in sand. Since the normal stresses on horizontal sections \nwere assumed to be intermediate principal stresses, the problem of \ncomputing the stresses in the sand surrounding the hole was a two-\ndimensional problem of plasticity. \nWhen a wide shaft is excavated in sand we may expect on the basis \nof construction experience that the timbering has to sustain an ap-\npreciable earth pressure. If the timbering is not strong enough to \nsustain this pressure, it fails, whereupon the surface of the sand sur-\nrounding the mouth of the shaft subsides. This type of deformation \nof the sand surrounding the shaft indicates a shear failure on approxi-\nmately cylindrical sections. It also indicates that the normal stresses \non horizontal sections exceed the strength of the sand. Therefore the \nanalysis contained in the preceding article cannot be applied to the \ncomputation of the earth pressure on the walls of shafts. \nThe intensity and the distribution of the earth pressure on the lining \nof shafts undoubtedly depends to a certain extent on the method of con-\nstruction. Our present knowledge does not yet permit us to take this \neffect into consideration. In order to get at least some information \nconcerning the influence of the diameter and the depth of the shaft and \nof the angle of internal friction of the sand on the earth pressure we solve \nby approximation the following problem.

The pressure area efg on the right-hand side \nof the center line of the shaft shown in Figure 61a shows the distribution \nof the lateral pressure on a. cylindrical section with an arbitrary radius r. \nBefore the shaft is constructed, the pressure per unit of area acting on \nthis section at any depth z is equal to",

If the sheet piles have been driven \nonly to a shallow depth, the deflection of the bulkhead is somewhat \nsimilar to that of a vertical elastic beam whose lower end d is simply \nsupported without being fixed, as shown in Figure 63a. \nBulkheads \nwhich satisfy this condition are called bulkheads with free earth support. \nOn the other hand, if sheet piles have been driven to a considerable depth, \nas indicated in Figure 63b, the lower end of the bulkhead is practically \nfixed in its position, because the resistance of the sand adjoining the end \ndoes not permit more than an insignificant deviation of the piles from \ntheir initial, vertical position. Therefore bulkheads of this type will \nbe called bulkheads with fixed earth support. An adequately anchored \nbulkhead with free earth support can fail either by bending or, on \naccount of a failure of the sand adjoining the contact face bd, by shear \nalong a curved surface of sliding df. \nA securely anchored bulkhead with \nfixed earth support can fail only by bending. \n78. Distribution of active earth pressure on bulkheads. On ac-\ncount of the boundary deformation conditions described in Article 76 \nthe distribution of the active earth pressure on a bulkhead is non-\nhydrostatic. The results of theoretical investigations (Schoenweller \n1929, Ohde 1938) and experience indicate that the distribution of the \nactive earth pressure is similar to the distribution indicated by a dashed \ncurve aSlt1 in Figure 64. It is also known from both theory and experi-\nence that the total active earth pressure on the bulkhead is approxi-\nmately equal to the Coulomb pressure on the back of a retaining wall, \nwhich is determined by equations 23(1). However, the methods which \nhave been worked out for determining the distribution of the pressure \ndo not take the elastic properties of the soil into consideration. The \nimportance of the error due to disregarding this vital factor is not yet \nknown. Furthermore, the elaborate character of the procedures con-\nceals the manifold arbitrary assumptions on which the procedures are \nbased and inspire an unwarranted confidence in the reliability of the \nresults. Hence, pending further increase of our knowledge of this \nsubject, the author suggests that the influence of the nonhydrostatic \ndistribution of the pressure on the maximum bending moment M 0 should \nbe estimated on the basis of our purely empirical knowledge of earth \npressure phenomena, as explained in the following paragraph. \nFigure 64 is a vertical section through a bulkhead with fixed earth \nsupport.

If the anchorage shown in Fig-\nure 70c consists not of a continuous wall but of individual plates whose \nwidth b is equal to their height HI the passive failure in the sand ad-\njoining the plate spreads over a width in excess of the width b, as shown \nin Figure 70d by the line ele2' Before the anchor pull is applied the \nsand is in a state of rest. The corresponding coefficient of earth pressure \nis approximately 0.5 and the frictional resistance along any section \nthrough the fill is equal to the normal component of the earth pressure at \nrest times the coefficient of internal friction, tan rp. \nAs soon as the \nanchor pull is applied the horizontal pressure in the sand increases \nwithin a roughly cone-shaped zone extending from the anchor plate \ntoward the left. Prior to the application of the anchor pull the total \nhorizontal pressure on the vertical sections represented by the lines alCl \nand a2C2 through the passive wedge in Figure 70d is equal to the earth \npressure at rest, Po, and the corresponding resistance against sliding \nalong these surfaces is Po tan cp. \nAs the anchor pull increases, the, \npressure on these two sections and the corresponding resistance to sliding \nalso increases very considerably. Therefore the slip occurs along the \nouter boundaries of the zone of compression produced by the anchor \npull, and the surface of sliding intersects the surface of the fill along a \ncrescent-shaped line ele2 (Fig. 70d). \nThe resistance to sliding along \nthe wide inclined sides of such a surface is undoubtedly greater tha.n",

        "text": "The solution of this equation can be represented by two sets of curves \nwhich intersect each other in every- point at right angles. The curves \nof one set are called the flow lines and those of the other one the equi-\npotential lines. At every- point of an equipotential line the water rises \nin an observation well to the same elevation. In accordance with this \ndefinition the horizontal surface of the ground on the upstream side of \nthe diaphragm represents one equipotential line and that on the down-\nstream side another. \nFurthermore the contours of the embedded part of the diaphragm and \nthe section through the base of the permeable stratum represent flow \nlines. These data constitute the hydraulic boundary conditions for the \nflow of seepage and permit the solution of equation 2. \nIn Figure 73a \nthis solution is graphically represented by a flow net which satisfies \nboth equation 2 and the boundary- conditions (Forchheimer 1917). \nIn complicated cases the flow net can also be determined graphically, \nby trial and error, by a hydraulic model test or on the bases of the \nelectric analogue to the process of the flow of seepage. A brief review \nof all these methods has recently been published CA. Casagrande 1937). \nComplete treatises on this subject are also available CMuskat 1937). \nFigure 74 represents several flow nets to be used as a guide when \nusing the graphical method. For reasons which will be explained in \nthe following article the individual curves which constitute the flow \nnets are always selected in such a manner that all the fields enclosed \nbetween the two sets are approximately square. \nFigures 74a to 74d represent the seepage through a uniformly per-\nmeable stratum beneath the base of concrete storage dams with differ-\nent cross sections. The permeability of the graded filters indicated in \nFigures 74c and 74d is assumed to be very great compared with that of \nthe natural soil. Hence the area of contact between the soil and the \nfilters represents the equivalent of a free exit surface. In each of the \ncases represented by Figures 74a to 74d the boundaries of the zone of \nseepage are identical with the boundaries of the permeable stratum. \nHence the hydraulic boundary conditions are determined by the section \nthrough this stratum and by the position of the free-water levels above it. \nFigure 74e is a section through a homogeneous earth dam which \nserves as a storage dam. On the downstream side the embankment \nrests on a horizontal layer of sand and gravel whose permeability is \nvery great compared with that of the construction material of the dam.",

        "text": "Therefore this layer acts as a toe drain. The uppermost flow line ab is \ncommonly known as line of 8aturation or line of 8eepage. It represents \nthe upper boundary of the zone of seepage. \nThe seepage water enters the dam through the upstream slope and \nit flows toward the left boundary of the drainage layer. The fact that \nthe position of the boundary ab is not known in advance complicates \nthe problem of constructing the flow net. However, since this bound-\nary coincides with a flow line, it can be determined graphically, by \ntrial and error (A. Casagrande 1937). The method is based on the \nassumption that the capillary forces have no influence on the position \nof the uppermost flow line. In connection with fine-grained soils this \nassumption is not even approximately justified (see Art. 111). If a \nhomogeneous earth dam consisting of sandy soil is sufficiently water-\ntight to retain the water in a reservoir, a rainstorm is likely to estab-\nlish a flow of seepage within the entire body of the dam as shown in \nFigure 74f. \nDuring the rainstorm the dam is less stable than during \na dry spell. \nAll the flow nets represented in Figure 74 were constructed on the \nassumption that the soil located within the zone of seepage is hy-\ndraulically homogeneous. \nIn other words, it has been assumed that \nthe permeability of the stratum is the same in every direction. In \nnature almost all accumulations of soil are stratified, i.e., they are \ncomposed of successive layers with different coefficients of permeability. \nLet",

However, as soon as this \ncritical value is approached the discharge increases more rapidly than \nthe head, indicating an increase of the average permeability of the sand. \nSimultaneously the surface of the sand rises within a belt with a width \nof approximately D /2, as shown in Figure 79a, and finally a mixture of \nsand and water breaks through the space located below the sheet piles. \nThis phenomenon is called piping, and the hydraulic head at which \npiping takes place is the critical head hp • \nPiping beneath a cofferdam is \nlikely to cause a failure of the cofferdam. Our problem is to determine \nthe factor of safety with respect to piping of the cofferdam shown in \nFigure 79a after the water level has been lowered within the cofferdam \nto a depth hl below the outside water level. \nThe process described in the preceding paragraph suggests that the \npiping is initiated by an expansion of the sand between the buried part \nof the sheet piles and a distance of about D/2 downstream from the \nsheet piles. This expansion is followed by an expulsion of the sand out \nof this zone. No such phenomenon could occur unless the water \npressure overcame the weight of the sand located within the zone of \nexpulsion. With sufficient accuracy we can assume that the body of \nsand which is lifted by the water has the shape of a prism with a width \nD /2 and a horizontal base at some depth Da below the surface. The \nrise of the prism is resisted by the weight of the prism and by the fric-\ntion along the vertical sides of the prism. At the instant of failure \nthe effective horizontal pressure on the sides of the prism and the \ncorresponding frictional resistance are practically zero. Therefore \nthe prism rises as soon as the total water pressure on its base becomes \nequal to the sum of the weight of the prism, sand and water combined. \nThe head hp at which the body is lifted is the critical head. The eleva-\ntion of the base of the body is determined by the condition that hp \nshould be a minimum because piping occurs as soon as the water is able \nto lift a prism of sand regardless of where its base is located. Figure \n79b shows the base at an arbitrary depth Da•",

OX represents the critical section, and the \nordinates h of the curve C represent the height of a layer of water \nwhose weight is equal to the excess hydrostatic pressure on the critical \nsection. By plotting above the line OX the values h'Ywh' we obtain \nthe curve W. This curve represents the upper boundary of an imaginary \nmass of earth with a unit weight 'Y' whose weight is equal to the excess \nhydrostatic pressure on the critical section. In order to establish a \nfactor of safety G8 with respect to piping, the pressure on the critical sec-\ntion due to the submerged weight of the earth and the surcharge should \nbe equal to G8 times the total excess hydrostatic pressure on the base \nof the prism. By multiplying the ordinates of the curve W by G8 we \nget the curve G (Fig. 79c). In order to obtain a factor of safety G. \nwe must charge the section ab of the surface of the sand with a weight \nequal to the shaded area times the submerged weight 'Y' of the sand. \nExperiments have shown that a uniformly distributed surcharge has \npractically the same effect on the critical head as the surcharge repre-\nsented by the shaded area in Figure 79c provided that the width of the \nuniform surcharge is approximately equal to the width ab of the base \nof the shaded area. Since the surcharge is located above the water \nlevel the effective unit weight of the surcharge is roughly equal to \ntwice the submerged unit weight 'Y'. \nHence the cross-sectional area of \nthe required surcharge would be approximately equal to about one half \nthat of the shaded area. \n96.

If a gap opens up between the sheet piles and the concrete a \nmixture of sand and water escapes through this gap and the structure \nfails at a hydraulic head which is very much smaller than that required \nto lift the sand located on the downstream side of the sheet piles. Since \nthe connection between the sheet piles and the concrete has seldom \nreceived the attention which it deserves, it is by no means impossible \nthat some dams have failed owing to a break in this connection and the \nconsequent piping through the gap. Failures due to piping usually occur \nwithin a very short time, and the destruction is so complete that it is \npractically impossible to reconstruct after the accident the real cause of \nevents. \nThe value Pp of the passive earth pressure also determines the \nbearing capacity of the sand which supports the dam. As the value \nPp approaches zero the ultimate bearing capacity of the sand located \non the left side of the sheet piles also approaches the value zero, and it is \nconceivable that a dam may fail on account of inadequate support \nalthough the sand beneath the dam may be firm and dense. \nThe preceding examples illustrate the various mechanical effects of \nseepage which tend to produce failure of dams on permeable foundations. \nOn account of the variety of conditions which are likely to be encoun-\ntered in actual practice no general rules can be established. Yet, in \nevery special case the effect of the flow of seepage on the theoretical \nfactor of safety of the structure can be estimated on the basis of the \ngeneral principles established in Articles 87 to 94. The real factor of \nsafety depends on details of stratification and other minor geologic \nfactors which cannot be determined in advance. Therefore the results \nof an analysis pertaining to the safety of a structure with respect to \npiping always requires subsequent verification or modification on the \nbasis of the results of water pressure measurements to be performed \nduring construction or during the period when hydraulic head is applied \nfor the first time. Whatever tbe results of such an investigation may \nbe, it is usually possible to eliminate the existing sources of danger by \nappropriate measures of drainage or by means of the loaded filters \ndescribed in the preceding article.",

Fundamental conceptions. \nIn the preceding chapter on seepage \nand seepage effects it was assumed that the volume occupied by the \nwater per unit of volume of the soil is independent of the state of stress \nin the soil. If this condition is satisfied the quantity of water which \nflows out of an element of the soil such as that shown in Figure 73b is \nequal to the quantity of water which enters the element, regardless of \nwhether or not the state of stress in the soil changes. This condition, \nknown as the continuity condition, is expressed in mathematical terms \nby the differential equation 89(1). There is no real soil which strictly \nsatisfies the continuity condition, because every change in the state of \nstress produces a certain change in the volume of voids, An, per unit \nvolume of the soil. Yet, if the soil is very permeable and not very com-\npressible, the change of the porosity due to a change in the state of \nstress in the soil can usually be disregarded. \nA change in the effective stresses in a highly compressible soil, such as \na clay or a sand-mica mixture, is likely to produce an important change \nAn in the volume of voids n. Hence if the voids of such a soil are com-\npletely filled with water and remain in that state a change in the effec-\ntive stresses involves a change in the water content of the soil. Every \nprocess involving a decrease of the water content of a saturated soil \nwithout replacement of the water by air is called a process of consoli-\ndation. The opposite process is called a process of swelling, which in-\nvolves an increase of the water content due to an increase of the volume \nof voids. \nA further complication arises if a soil combines high compressibility \nwith low permeability. Both of these properties are exhibited to a high \ndegree by fat clays. In soils with such characteristics, changes in the \nwater content due to changes in the state of stress take place very \nslowly, because the low permeability of the soil does not permit a rapid \ntransfer of the water from one part of the mass of soil to another or to \nan adjoining highly permeable stratum. \nThis phenomenon produces \na time lag between a change of the external forces which act on a \nfeebly permeable, compressible stratum and the corresponding change \nof the water content of the SOIL It is the principal cause of the pro-",

In Figure 83a the \nbed of clay with a thickness 2H is assumed to rest on a permeable base. \nHence the excess water can escape toward both the upper and lower sur-\nfaces of the clay stratum. Since the flow of the excess water out of the \nclay is symmetrical with reference to a plane at midheight of the bed \nof clay, the isochrones are also symmetrical, as shown in the figure. \nIn \nthe case represented by Figure 83b the bed of clay with a thickness \n2H also rests on a permeable base but the consolidation stresses are \nassumed to decrease from a value PI at the top to a smaller value P2 \nat the bottom, as shown in the figure by the straight line de. \nThis \nassumption approximates the stress conditions produced by a surcharge \nacting on a strip on the surface of the clay because the normal stress \non horizontal sections due to a local surcharge decreases with increasing \nvertical distance between the surface and the section. The isochrones \nresemble those in Figure 83a, but they are not symmetrical. During \nevery stage of the process the point of contact between the correspond-\ning isochrone and a horizontal tangent to this isochrone determines \nthe elevation of the boundary between the zones of upward and down-\nward drainage. This boundary passes through the point of intersection \nbetween the vertical through the point of contact and the inclined \n. section ab, as shown in Figure 83b. At time zero the boundary is \nidentical with that surface of the clay where the excess pressure is \ngreatest. As time goes on the boundary gradually approaches a hori-\nzontal plane at midheight of the bed of clay. These statements also \napply to every other process of consolidation involving drainage in two \ndirections such as the process illustrated by Figures 83c and 83e. \nIn Figure 83c the consolidation stresses are assumed to decrease from \nPl at the upper surface to zero at the lower, and the excess water can \nescape through both upper and lower surfaces. If the base of the clay \nis impermeable, the isochrones corresponding to the system of stresses \nindicated in Figure 83c intersect the zero isochrone dc, as shown in \nFigure 83d.

If the hydro-\nstatic head in the bed of sand beneath the clay is also increased by hI \nthe increase of the neutral stress is everywhere equal to the increase of \nthe total stress and both the effective stresses and the void ratio of the \nclay remain unaltered. On the other hand, if the hydrostatic head in \nthe sand is maintained at its original value, for instance, because the \nsand layer intersects the surface of the ground on the downstream side \nof t.he dam, as shown in the figure, the filling of the reservoir creates a \nflow of water from the reservoir through the clay into the sand. Once \nthis flow has become stationary, the hydrostatic head of the water at \nany point of the section ab (Fig. 84) through the clay is equal to the \nordinates of the straight line de with reference to the base of the fill. \nThese ordinates also determine the permanent increase 'YwhIZ/2H of the \nneutral stress in the clay. However, owing to the filling of the reser-\nvoir the total normal stresses on every horizontal section have increased \nby hl'Yw' Hence the filling of the reservoir ultimately increases the \neffective normal stresses on horizontal sections through the clay by",

Hence the simplified method of compu-\ntation is based on the assumption that the isochrones are parabolas. \nAs time goes on the apex of the parabolic isochrones advances first from \nd in Figure 82 in a horizontal direction toward e and then in a vertical \ndownward direction from e toward c. The rate at which the apex \ntravels determines the quantity of excess water which drains out of the \nclay per unit of time. At the surface the hydraulic gradient must \nalways be equal to the gradient required to maintain the flow of the \nexcess water toward the surface. This condition makes it possible to \ndetermine the rate of displacement of the isochrones and the corre-\nsponding rate of consolidation. The time factor-consolidation curve \nobtained by means of this procedure is almost identical with the curve \nrepresenting the rigorous solution. \nThe replacement of the real isochrones by simpler curves is strictly \ncomparable to Coulomb's method of substituting plane surfaces of \nsliding in the backfill of retaining walls for the real surfaces, which are \nslightly curved. \n(See Art. 23.) Many approximate solutions of con-\nsolidation problems have already been published (Terzaghi 1925, Terzaghi \nand Frohlich, 1936), and the method can easily be adapted to problems \nwhich have not yet been solved. \n104.

Figure SSe shows the layout of the \nsystem of wells. The vertical sections indicated by dash-dotted lines divide the \nconsolidating layer of clay into prismatic blocks. \nWithin each block the drainage \nproceeds as if the vertical sides of the block were lined with an impermeable mem-\nbrane, because the excess water in the clay located on either side of each vertical \nsection escapes in opposite directions. The problem of computing the rate of drain-\nage can be simplified without appreciable error by assuming that each block is \ncylindrical. \nOn this assumption the flow is symmetrical about the axis of the block. \nWithin the block the flow of the water toward the exit surfaces proceeds as if the \ncylindrical surface of the block were covered with an impermeable material. \nIf the permeability of the clay in a vertical direction is different from that in a \nradial direction the consolidation of the cylindrical block is represented by equa-\ntion 7. \nRapid application of the weight of the fill produces throughout the block \nan excess hydrostatiC pressure equal to the weight of the fill q per unit of area of the \ntop surface of the block. As time goes on this excess pressure gradually approaches \nzero. \nSimultaneously the effective stresses in the clay increase and approach a \nconstant value which is equal to the total increase of the stress in the clay produced \nby the weight of the fill. The outer cylindrical surface and the base of the block \nare impermeable and the excess water escapes through the top surface and the walls \nof the well. \nThese are the boundary conditions. \nThe flow of the excess water \nthrough the block can be resolved into two components, one vertical component in \nthe direction of the centerline of the filter well (direction of the Z axis) and one \nhorizontal, radial component directed toward the filter well. \nThe boundary con-\nditions for the vertical linear flow are identical with those for the consolidation due \nto sudden application of a surcharge q per unit of area on a bed of clay with a thick-\nness H which rests on an impermeable base (half-closed layer). \n(See Art. 102.) \nThe relation between the time t and the degree of consolidation U.% is determined \nby the equation",

Therefore the filter wells are much more effective than one \nshould expect from a computation of the influence of the wells on the rate of consoli-\ndation on the assumption that the bed is hydraulically isotropic k = k, or n = ]. \nFilter wells have also been used to accelerate the consolidation of beds of clay or silt \nwhich have been artificially deposited by some hydraulic process. If such a fill is \nlocated above a highly permeable layer one can further increase the efficacy of the \nwells by maintaining the water level in the wells at the level of the base of the fill \nby pumping. In either case the rate of consolidation can be estimated by means of \na procedure similar to that described above. \nAnother, less important but more difficult, problem involving a three-dimensional \nflow of the excess water out of a consolidating clay presents itself in connection with \nthe computation of the rate of settlement of a local surcharge on the horizontal \nsurface of a bed of clay whose thickness is great compared with the width of the \narea covered by the surcharge. A first attempt to solve the problem was made \nby Biot (1935b) on the assumption that the clay obeys Hooke's law and that the \nexcess water escapes only in a vertical direction. \nAt a later date the same investigator formulated a general theory of three-dimen-\nsional consolidation (Biot 1941a). On the basis of this theory he computed the \nconsolidation settlement under a uniformly distributed load covering a rectangular \narea on the surface of a bed of clay (Biot 1941b) and the consolidation due to a load \nacting on a bed of clay whose top surface is impermeable (Riot and Clingan, 1941). \nHe also investigated the progressive settlement of loaded, elastic slabs resting on a \nbed of ideal clay (Biot and Clingan, 1942). \nAll these investigations were based on the assumption that the coefficient of con-\nsolidation Cv contained in equation 1 is a constant. For processes of consolidation \ninvolving linear flow j,his assumption is known to be reasonably accurate. However, \nin connection with two- and three-dimensional processes of consolidation, the same \nassumption should be regarded as a potential source of errors whose importance is \nnot yet known. Biot also assumed that Cv has the same value for both compression \nand swelling. This assumption is never justified. A better approximation could \nbe obtained by assuming that Cv for swelling is equal to infinity.",

        "text": "113. Types of drainage. The term drainage is applied to the process \nof artificial withdrawal of water from a body of soil. In connection with \nengineering operations drainage is used to increase the stability of the \nsoil prior to excavation or prior to the application of loads. In either \ncase the increase of stability is due to the reduction of the neutral \nstresses in the soil at practically unaltered total stresses. In order to \ndrain a soil it is necessary to lower the water table. The terms ground-\nwater level, phreatic water level, water table, or ground-water surface indi-\ncate the level to which the water rises in piezometric tubes whose lower \nend is located immediately below this level. If the ground water is \nstationary, the water rises in every tube to the same elevation regardless \nof the location of the lower end of the tubes. \nIf the water flows through the soil, the ground-water surface is aL\"!o \nsometimes called the line of saturation. However, this term is misleading, \nbecause every soil is in a state of complete capillary saturation up to \nsome elevation above the water table. At the upper boundary of the \nzone of complete capillary saturation the piezometric head is always \nnegative, whereas the water table is the locus of all those points in a mass \nof soil for which the piezometric head is equal to zero. \nThe lowering of the water table can be accomplished by constructing \nwithin the soil a system of ditches or tunnels with a gravity outlet \n(drainage by gravity), by pumping from wells or ditches (drainage \nby pumping), or by surface evaporation (drainage by desiccation). \nThe excess water may escape along straight, parallel lines (linear drain-\nage), by flow along curves in parallel planes (two-dimensional drainage), \nin radial planes (radial drainage), or by flow along lines having a three-\ndimensional curvature (general case of a three-dimensional drainage). \nIn connection with the practical application of drainage it is often \nuseful or necessary to know in advance the approximate time required \nto drain the major part of the excess water out of the soil. The rate \nat which the water escapes is called the rate of drainage. \nFor a given \nlayout of the drainage system both the rate and the effect of drainage \ndepend on the physical characteristics of the soil subject to drainage, \nsuch as grain size and compressibility. \nThese characteristics range",

Within the zone of transition the rate of flow depends \nnot only on the hydraulic gradient and on the size of the voids but also \non the degree of saturation and on several other factors. \nThe theories \nwhich take these factors into consideration (Gardner 1936; see also \nWilson and Richards, 1938, and Baver 1940) are so involved that they \nare not yet fit for practical application.

Drainage of an ideal clay embankment after a sudden drawdown. \nFigure lOOa shows a cross-section through an embankment made of \nideal clay whose unit weight is 'Y. \nThe submerged unit weight is 'Y' \nand the height H of the embankment is smaller than the height of capil-\nlary rise. The embankment rests on an impermeable base and it is \nalmost completely submerged in a. pond. The clay is assumed to be \nin a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. Hence the water rises at every \npoint of the embankment in a piezometric tube to the level of the water \nin the pond. If we suddenly empty the pond the piezometric head \nbecomes temporarily equal to zero at every point of the slopes of the \nembankment. As time goes on the water content of the clay adapts \nitself to the new hydraulic boundary conditions. However, imme-\ndiately after the drawdown the water content is practically identical \nwith what it was before. \nIn order to visualize the influence of this condition on the state of \nstress in the fill immediately after a drawdown we investigate the state \nof stress on a horizontal section through the fill at an elevation z above \nits base.

The \nright-hand side of Figure lOOb shows the lines of equal neutral stress and \nthe left-hand side the lines of equal head for the state immediately \nafter the drawdown. \nIn reality the fill material is not laterally confined. As a consequence \nthe drawdown changes not only the total normal stress on horizontal \nsections but also the shearing stresses. This change is associated with \na. change of the effective principal stresses at unaltered water content, \nwhich in turn produces a supplementary change in the neutral stresses. \nThis change can either be positive or negative. It depends on the rela-\ntion between stress and volume change for the fill material and cannot yet \nbe computed. Hence at the very best, the state of stress represented \nby Figure 100b is approximately correct. \nDuring the subsequent process of drainage the clay remains in a state \nof complete capillary saturation and the total quantity of water which \nflows out of the embankment is equal to the total decrease of the volume \nof the voids due to consolidation. Since the hydraulic head decreases \nfrom the central part of the fill in both directions the excess water drains \ntoward the lowest parts be of the slopes, as shown in Figure 100e. At \nevery point of the discharge area the hydraulic head with reference to \nthe toes of the embankment remains equal to its initial value. Within \nthe upper and the central parts of the embankment the neutral stress \nand the corresponding hydraulic head decrease. The equations of \nthe curves of equal head and of equal neutral stress could be derived \nby means of the differential equation 106(2).

        "text": "121. Drainage by desiccation. \nWe know from experience that a \nspecimen of saturated clay in contact with the atmosphere gradually \ndries out from the surface toward the interior. This process involves a \ncontinuous flow of water from the interior of the clay toward the sur-\nface of evaporation. At the surface the discharge velocity is equal \nto the rate of evaporation, Ve per unit of area and per unit of time. \nThe neutral stress due to the weight of the water contained in the \nspecimen is negligible. Therefore, as long as the water contained in \nthe clay is in a. state of equilibrium, the neutral stress throughout \nthe specimen is either almost equal to zero or else it is everywhere \nnegative. Yet, as soon as one exposes the surface of the clay to evapora-\ntion, the water drains from the interior of the specimen toward the sur-\nface which in turn requires the existence of a hydraulic gradient. Since \nthe neutral stress in the interior of the specimen did not increase, \nthe existence of the hydraulic gradient indicates a decrease in the \nneutral stress at the surface. The only one known agent which can \nproduce such a decrease without any change in the external conditions \nis the surface tension of the water. \nIf we eliminate further evaporation before air has entered the voids \nof the clay, the clay is still in a saturated state. Yet its void ratio \nis appreciably smaller than the initial void ratio and subsequent im-\nmersion causes the clay to swell. The inflow of water into the clay \nrequires a hydraulic gradient, which is directed toward the interior \nof the clay. Since the surface of the swelling specimen is in direct \ncontact with free water we are obliged to assume that the water con-\ntained in the clay is in a state of tension. \nIn order to visualize the state of stress in a partly desiccated mass \nof clay and its relation to the surface tension we analyze the forces which \nact on a bundle of highly compressible capillary tubes whose radii \nare equal to T. \nThe tubes are completely filled with water as shown \nin Figures lOla and lOlb. Pressures due to the weight of the water \nare considered negligible compared to the forces produced by the \nsurface tension, and the area of the section through the walls of the",

As \nsoon as the neutral stress in the water becomes equal to u, further \nevaporation causes the surface of the water to recede into the interior \nof the soil while the stress in the water retains its value u,. \nIn practice it may occasionally be necessary to estimate in advance \nthe rate of consolidation of a bed of clay by drying. After the desicca-\ntion is complete the neutral stress throughout the clay is equal to \nu, = -\n'Ywhc (eq.3). Since the weight of the water which evaporates \nis small compared with the total weight of the clay the total normal \nstress on horizontal sections through the clay remains practically con-\nstant. Therefore the process of drying increases the vertical effective \npressure of the clay by P. = - u,. The same ultimate effect can be \nobtained by consolidating the clay under a surface load p. = 'Ywhc per \nunit of area. If the clay rests on an impermeable base as assumed in \nthe computation illustrated by Figure 82, the excess water escapes \nduring both processes in an upward direction through the surface of the \nclay. Yet, though the final effect of both processes is the same, the \nrate of consolidation is governed by different laws, because the boundary \nconditions are different. In order to visualize this difference we make \na vertical section (Fig. 102a) through the clay, similar to the section \nshown in Figure 82 and plot the piezograph for the state of stress on a \nplane ab which rises at an angle of 45° to the horizontal. The dashed \ncurves above ac are the isochrones for consolidation under a surface \nload p, per unit of area and are identical with those shown in Figure 82. \nAt any time t' the water stands in a piezometric tube above an arbitrary \npoint m of the plane ab at the level of the point l' which is located at \nthe intersection between a vertical line through m and the isochrone \nfor time t'.

        "text": "dCl (Fig. 102a) the water in the clay is the seat of a hydraulic gradient \ndirected toward the surface of the clay. Since ouch a gradient is in-\ncompatible with the hydraulic equilibrium in the clay for Ve = 0, \nwater flows from the lower part of the bed of clay into the upper one \nuntil the hydraulic gradient becomes equal to zero. This process \ninvolves a consolidation of the lower part and a swelling of the upper \npart of the clay. At the end of this process the excess hydrostatic \npressure is equal to -I'whl throughout the bed of clay. Such a process \nis called an adiabatic process. The value hl is determined by the con-\ndition that the average water content of the clay remains constant \nduring the entire process. At time t = co the water stands in every \npiezometric tube on the line dlel at a depth hl below the surface. There-\nfore the line dlel represents the final isochrone for this process. \nIn the thermodynamic analogue this process corresponds to the \nupward migration of heat in a horizontal layer with insulated surfaces, \nwhose initial temperature decreases from the base toward the top. \nAs time goes on the temperature gradient gradually disappears and the \ntemperature of the layer becomes everywhere equal to the average of the \ninitial temperatures. \nIf the surface of the clay is flooded at the stage represented by the final \nisochrone dlel (Fig. 102a) the hydrostatic head at the surface becomes \nequal to zero against - hl in the interior of the clay. The corresponding \nhydraulic gradient causes an infiltration of free water into the interior \nof the clay. The zero isochrone for this process is dlel in Figure 102b \nand the final isochrone is ac. \nThe isochrones for this process of swelling",

It also shifts the position of the effec-\ntive weight towa~ the right-hand side as shown in the figure. The \neffective reaction F acts at an angle cjJ to the normal on the surface of \nsliding and the effective part P A of the active earth pressure acts at an \nangle a to the normal on the back of the wall. The pressure P A can \nbe determined by anyone of the methods described in Chapter VI, \nafter substituting the value 'Yr (eq. 1) for the unit weight \"I of the fill. \nWhen assuming that the point of application of PAis located at the \nelevation of the point of intersection tl between the effective weight W \nand the potential surface of sliding TS one makes a slight error on the \nsafe side. \nAnother group of problems of practical importance deals with the \neffect of a rapid drawdown on the stability of embankments. The \ndrawdown initiates a process of drainage. During drainage the factor \nof safety with respect to sliding increases; and after drainage is complete \nit is even higher than it was before drainage, because the surface tension \nof the water reduces the danger of sliding. Therefore the greatest \ndanger exists immediately after the drawdown, and the subsequent \nstages do not need to be taken into consideration. \nIf a completely immersed embankment consists of fine sand the \ndistribution of the neutral stresses immediately after a sudden draw-\ndown was found to be slightly more favorable than the corresponding \nstate of stress in the water during a heavy rainstorm which produces a \nstate of complete saturation. (See Art. 116.) Hence, if the slopes of \nsuch an embankment are stable during long wet spells before the slopes \nwere submerged they are also stable after a sudden drawdown. \nIn connection with an investigation of the effect of a sudden draw-\ndown on the stability of slopes on cohesive soil such as clay it is neces-\nsary to consider the incapacity of the clay to adapt its water content \nrapidly to a change in the state of stress. To illustrate the method of \ninvestigation we determine the factor of safety with respect to sliding \nof the upstream slope of the earth dam shown in Figure 74e immediately \nafter a sudden drawdown of the water level in the reservoir to the level \nof the foot of the slope. Figure l04a is a duplicate of the section repre-\nsented by Figure 74e. \nAs indicated in the discussion of Figure 74e, in",

If a load or a system of loads \nis transmitted onto the soil either by rigid or by elastic footings the \nbase of the footings is acted upon by the contact pressure whose total \nmagnitude is equal to the total load on the bearing area. The distri-\nbution of the contact pressure over the bearing area depends on both the \nphysical properties of the supporting earth and on the elastic prop-\nerties of the footing. A computation of the contact pressure shows, \nin agreement with experience, that the ratio between the unit contact \npressure at a given point of the base of a footing and the settlement \nof that point is different for different points of the contact area. For \ninstance, every point of the base of a rigid footing which carries a centric \nload settles through the same distance. Yet the distribution of the con-\ntact pressure over the bearing area is non-uniform. \nSince the rigorous methods of computing the distribution of the \ncontact pressure are too complicated for application to routine prob-\nlems it is customary to simplify the computation by the arbitrary as-\nsumption that the ratio between the unit contact pressure and the \nsettlement is the same for every point of the bearing area. In other \nwords it is assumed that the settlement of any fraction of a loaded area \nis independent of the size of the area and of the load which acts on \nthe balance of the area. \nThis assumption is incompatible with the mechanical properties of \nsolids and soils in general. In order to establish agreement between \nassumption and reality it would be necessary to replace the soil sup-\nport of the footing by a bed of equally spaced and equally compressible \nsprings each one of which is independent of the others, as shown in \nFigure 141a. This is a highly artificial concept. Therefore the results \nof computation based on this concept must be considered crude esti-\nmates. Nevertheless most of the current methods for computing",

In order to distinguish between the \npressure computed by means of one of these methods and the real con-\ntact pressure or the contact pressure computed by means of the theory \nof plasticity or the theory of elasticity, the former will be called the \nsubgrade reaction. \nThe ratio between the unit subgrade reaction and \nthe corresponding settlement is known as the coejficien' of subgrade re-\naction. The methods of computing the contact pressure by means \nof the theory of elasticity will be discussed in the next chapter. \n124. Coefficients ~f soil and pile reaction. The coefficient of sub-\ngrade reaction is defined as the ratio pip between a load p per unit \nof area of the horizontal surface of a mass of soil and the corresponding \nsettlement p of the surface. The ratio between a horizontal pressure \np per unit of area of a vertical surface and the corresponding horizontal \ndisplacement is called the coejficient of lwrizontal soil reaction. \nThe \nratio Qlp between the load Q on a foundation pile and the settlement p \nof the pile represents the coefficient of vertical pile reaction. \nIn order to secure the data required to assign a reasonable value \nto these coefficients we may apply a uniform pressure on an exposed \nsurface of the soil; then we measure the deflection at different points. \ndivide the unit pressure by the deflection at different points, and take the \naverage of the values thus obtained. Or we ti-ansmit a known total \npressure onto the soil by means of a rigid body, such as a block of \nconcrete, measure the displacement, and compute the ratio between unit \npressure and displacement. When dealing with piles we may apply a \nload Q on each member of a group of uniformly spaced piles, measure \nthe settlement of each pile, and take the average. Or we apply a \ngiven total load by means of a block of concrete onto the group of piles \nand divide the load per pile by the settlement of the block. In either \ncase both procedures involve an arbitrary element inasmuch as we \nreplace a variable ratio by an average value, the fictitious coefficient \nof subgrade reaction. The importance of the error due to this substitu-\ntion will be discussed in the next chapter. \nFrom experience it is known that a uniformly distributed load on a \ncircular or rectangular area of the horizontal surface of a cohesive soil \nproduces a bowl-shaped depression, as shown in Figure 105a. In \nother words the settlement decreases from the central part of the loaded \narea toward the periphery. The average settlement is p. Experience \nhas also shown that the average settlement increases at a higher rate \nthan the unit load.

Originally the theory was worked out for the purpose of computing \nthe bending moments in railroad ties supported by ballast (Zimmermann 1888). It \nwas used for this purpose by the American Society of Civil Engineers' \"Committee \nto report on stresses in railroad tracks\" (Talbot 1918). \nIn 1911 the author applied the theory for the first time to the design of a founda-\ntion consisting of a grillage of heavy reinforced concrete beams. In later years the \ntheory was also applied to the design of locks made of reinforced concrete (Freund \n1917, 1924) and to the computation of the bending moments in hard road surfaces \nacted upon by concentrated loads (Westergaard 1926). \nFigures lOBa to 108d show \nelastic beams and simple frames which transmit vertical loads onto masses of soil. \nThe loading conditions illustrated by Figures 108e to 108j are frequently met in con-\nnection with the design of locks. The walls of a lock are practically rigid (I = co) \nwhereas the floor construction is relatively flexible (see Figs. 108g and 108h). \nThe symbol M in Figures 108h and 108j indicates a couple. The equations for \ncomputing the bending moments in structures acted upon by the forces shown \nin Figure 108 and by various other systems of forces have been assembled by",

Therefore the space located \nbeneath the loaded area is commonly called the bulb of pressure. \nFrom \nthis explanation of the meaning of the term it is obvious that no definite \ndimensions can be assigned to the bulb of pressure beneath a given \nloaded area, unless one specifies that the vertical normal stress at \nthe boundary of the bulb should correspond to a certain fraction, for \ninstance % or X, of the unit load q. \nThe computation of the stresses due to a uniformly distributed load \non a rectangular or a circular area are rather involved, and the results \nof the computation cannot be represented by a 8imple set of equa-\ntions. However, the problem has been solved and the results have \nbeen compiled in tables which make it possible to determine the stresses \nin any point by means of a simple process of interpolation (Love 1928). \nThe vertical normal stress at a depth Ii: below the center of a circular area \nwith a radius R which carries a unit load q is",

The figure shows that the difference between the \ntwo curves becomes very small for values of z/B in excess of six. Hence \nin a computation of the normal stresses on a horizontal section at a depth \nz below a continuous load on a finite area. it is admissible to replace this \nload by point loads spaced not in excess of 21/3. \nThe stresses produced",

In other words, \nthe central part of the loaded area settles more than the peripheral \nparts. \n138. Transition from state of elastic to that of plastic equilibrium \nbeneath flexible loads. As soon as the stresses due to an increasing \nload satisfy the stress conditions for failure at one point the loaded \nmaterial fails at that point and a further increase of the load causes the \nfailure to spread until the bearing capacity of the material is exceeded. \nIn relatively rigid solids, such as concrete, very stiff clays, or cemented \nsand, the failure eliminates the cohesion at the point of failure and the \npropagation of the failure produced by an increase of the load is asso-\nciated with progressive injury to the loaded material. Therefore the \nload required to establish the stress conditions for failure at one point \nof the loaded material is almost equal to the greatest load which the \nfooting can carry. \nIn perfectly plastic materials the transition from the state of elastic \nequilibrium to that of incipient failure also spreads from local centers, \nbut the transition is not associated with a loss of strength. Therefore \nthe critical load is considerably greater than the load required to produce \nincipient failure at some point of the loaded material. During the \ntransition from incipient to ultimate failure an increase of the load \nproduces merely an increase of the size of the zone of plastic equilibrium. \nBefore the flow begins in a material combining ideal elasticity and \nideal plasticity, the stresses due to the load increase in simple proportion \nto the load and the orientation of the principal stresses remains un-\nchanged. After the flow has started this rule loses its validity and the \norientation of the principal stresses also changes.

Distribution of contact pressure over the base of footings. \nThe term contact pressure indicates the normal stress at the surface of \ncontact between a footing and the supporting earth. In Article 137 \nit was shown that a surcharge uniformly distributed over a finite part \nof the horizontal surface of a semi-infinite elastic solid always produces \na bowl-shaped settlement of the loaded area, similar to the settlement \nillustrated by Figures 122c and 122d. In order to produce at least a \nfairly uniform settlement the unit load on a circular area must be very \nmuch greater at the rim than at the center. In Figure 124a the sur-\ncharge increases from zero at the center in direct proportion to the square \nof the distance from the center. Nevertheless the center settles almost \nas much as the rim, as indicated by a dotted line below the base of the \nload (Boussinesq 1885). Hence if a perfectly uniform settlement is \nenforced by the absolute rigidity of a footing, the contact pressure must \nincrease from the center of the base of the footing toward the rim, \nprovided the supporting material is perfectly elastic. For an elastic \nfooting the distribution of the contact pressure depends on the elastic \nproperties of the supporting medium, on the flexural rigidity of the \nfooting, and on the distribution of the loads on the footing.",

At the surface, at the \nrim of the base of the slab, even a very small stress exceeds the stress \nconditions for failure. Hence at the rim the contact pressure can \nnever become greater than zero (see Art. 16). As the load increases \nthe contact pressure on the central part of the base increases, and at \nthe instant of failure the distribution of the contact pressure is roughly \nparabolic as indicated by the curve C\". \nIn that stage the average \ncontact pressure q\"( is equal to the bearing capacity factor N\"( (eq. \n45(4b» times the unit weight 'Y of the sand times one half of the width \nof the footing. \nIf the bearing capacity of the soil is due to internal friction as well as \nto cohesion, the successive stages are as indicated by the curves C1, \nC2, and C\" (Fig. 126e), which corresponds to Figure 3ge. A similar \ndistribution of the contact pressure should be expected if the base of \na rigid footing is located at a considerable depth below the surface of \na layer of dense sand. \nAccording to the methods of computation based on the assumption \nthat the coefficient of subgrade reaction is constant (Chapter XVI), \nthe contact pressure on the base of a rigid footing should always be \nperfectly uniform provided the resultant of the load passes through the \ncenter of gravity of the base. Figure 126 illustrates the type and \nimportance of the errors which are likely to be associated with this \nradically simplifying assumption. \n141.

It can easily be demonstrated by laboratory experiments. \nIf we apply a load on a sample of a perfectly elastic material, acted \nupon by an initial all-round pressure, we find that the vertical strain \nproduced by the load is independent of the initial pressure. On the \nother hand, if we repeat the same test on a sand sample we find that \nthe strain due to the load decreases with increasing intensity of the all-\nround pressure. In a sand stratum the sand is under the influence of an \nall-round pressure due to the weight of the sand. The intensity of this \npressure increases with the depth below the surface. Hence, the strain \nproduced by a given change of the stress in the sand decreases with in-\ncreasing depth below the surface. In order to take this property of \nsands into account without losing the simplicity resulting from assuming \nthe validity of the law of superposition, we proceed in the following \nmanner. We assume that the sand strictly obeys Hooke's law but \nwe also assume that the modulus of elasticity of the sand increases with \ndepth according to a definite law. In other words we assume that the \nsand is perfectly elastic and isotropic in every horizontal direction but \nelastically nonhomogeneous in a vertical direction. \nIn order to estimate the stresses in such materials Griffith (1929) \nand Frohlich (1934a) proposed a semi-empirical modification of Bous-\nsinesq's theory of incompressible elastic solids (Poisson's ratio JI. = 0.5). \nIf JI. = 0.5 the stresses produced by a vertical point load Q at any point N \n(Fig. lISa) of a semi-infinite, homogeneous solid represent the com-\nponents of a linear, principal stress (f[, whose intensity is determined by \nBoussinesq's equation 135(3)",

Equations 1 and 4 show that the average settlement \nproduced by a given load q per unit of square and of circular areas on the \nsurface of semi-infinite solids increases in direct proportion to the width \nof these areas. \nThese and similar computations lead to the following conclusion. \nFor a given load q and a given ratio l between the length and the width \nof the loaded area, both the settlement at the center of the area and the \naverage settlement increase in simple proportion to the width of the \nloaded area. The settlement of a circular area increases in direct pro-\nportion to the radius. However, the validity of this conclusion is \nlimited by the conditions that the loaded material is elastically isotropic \nand homogeneous and that it obeys Hooke's law. Thefollowingdevia-\ntions from these conditions will be considered: (a) The compressibility of \nthe material decreases with increasing depth below the surface; (b) the \nloaded material does not obey Hooke's law, and (c) the strain increases \nwith time at constant state of stress. \nIn practice we are never able to obtain more than an approximate \nknowledge of the elastic properties of a natural soil deposit. For this \nreason a rigorous analysis of the influence of aforementioned deviations \nof the elastic properties of soils from those assumed by Boussinesq on \nthe settlement is only of theoretical interest. The information which \nis needed for practical purposes can be obtained on the basis of radically \nsimplifying assumptions.",

For a. certain radius Rl the load per unit of area required to pro-\nduce a given settlement Pl is a maximum. This conclusion has been \nconfirmed repeatedly by experiment. \nThe influence of time on the settlement is illustrated by Figure 12ge. \nThis figure shows the relation between unit load and settlement obtained \nby means of a loading test on a mass of soil. If the unit load has been \nincreased at a constant rate, the line which connects the points represent-\ning the results of the observations is a smooth curve OacC. On the \nother hand, if the load has been kept constant for several hours or days, \nfrom time to to tl , the intermission appears in the diagram as a vertical \nline ab, regardless of the nature of the loaded soil. \nThe relation between \ntime and settlement at constant load is shown to the right of the line abo \nIf the process of loading is continued after time tl at the original rate of \nloading, the load-settlement curve gradually approaches the curve \nOacC, which represents the settlement associated with the uninterrupted \nloading process. \nThe relative importance of the time effect shown by \nthe vertical line ab and its physical causes are different for different soils. \nIn a test on sand or a sandy soil, the time effect is chiefly due to a lag \nin the adjustment of the sand grains to a change in the state of stress. \nIn connection with clays it is chiefly due to a temporary disturbance of \nthe state of hydrostatic equilibrium of the water contained in the voids \nof the clay, as described in Chapter XIII. In either case the final result \nis the same as if the elastic constants of the loaded material were a \nfunction of the rate at which the load is applied. \nFinally, in all the theories presented in the preceding articles it has \nbeen assumed that the compressible material which supports the load \nextends to an infinite depth. In nature every compressible soil stratum \nrests at a finite depth on a relatively incompressible base. The distance \nbetween the loaded area and this base represents one more variable \nfactor. The influence of this factor on the settlement will be discussed \nin Article 150. It is illustrated by Figure 138. \nThe preceding review of our present knowledge of the relation between \nthe settlement and the size of the loaded area demonstrated that this \nrela.tion is rather complicated. On account of the great number of \nvariable factors involved, it cannot be expressed by a simple rule of \ngeneral validity. For the same reason the usefulness of small-scale \nloading tests is limited. The extrapolation from the results of such tests \nto the settlement of loads on large areas can be very misleading. In no \ncase should such an extrapolation be attempted without careful con-\nsideration of all the factors which are likely to influence the difference",

The \nstresses after excavation of the tunnel are equal to the difference between \nthe circumferential stresses prior to excavation and those produced by \nthe liquid pressure. These stresses are represented by the radial width \nof the shaded area on the right-hand side of Figure 133b. The circum-\nferential and radial stresses along a horizontal section through the center-\nline are equal to the ordinates of the plain curves CIS and Clr respectively. \nIf the stresses in the vicinity of the tunnel exceed the yield point of \nthe soil, the preceding analysis cannot be applied. The stresses corre-\nsponding to a state of plastic equilibrium are shown for a deep tunnel in \nFigure 133c and for a tunnel at a shallow depth in Figure 133d. The \nradial distance between the dotted line and the wall of the tunnel on the \nleft-hand side of each profile represents the state of stress prior to the \nconstruction of the tunnel.",

If there is neither \nadhesion nor friction between the elastic layer and its base, the shearing \nstresses at al and bl are equal to zero. \nThe plain curve C~ represents \nthe distribution of the shearing stresses over aal on the assumption \nthat the elastic layer adheres to its base.

In order to compute the intensity and the distribution of \nthe pressure on the rigid base of an elastic layer acted upon by a load \ncovering a finite area one needs equations similar to Boussinesq's equa-\ntions 135(la) and 136(la). These equations can be derived on two \ndifferent assumptions. Either it is assumed that there is neither friction \nnor adhesion between the elastic layer and its base (frictionless base) \nor else perfect adhesion between the layer and the base is assumed \n(adhesive base). The problem of computing the pressure due to line \nloads has been solved for elastic layers on a frictionless base by Melan \n(1919) and on an adhesive base by Marguerre (1931). The equations \nfor the pressures produced by a point load on a layer with a frictionless \nbase have been derived by l\\Ielan (1919) and for a layer on an adhesive \nbase by Biot (1935a) and Passer (1935). \nBiot's solution for a point \nload on an elastic layer with an adhesive base may serve as an example",

If we replace the lower part of \nthe wedge, beneath a depth H, by rigid material, the state of stress in \nthe wedge becomes identical with that in an elastic layer with a vertical \nface and a thickness H, supported by and adhering to a rigid base. \nThe dashed line indicates the deformation of the layer due to its weight. \nAlong its upper horizontal surface the layer is in a state of tension. \nFrom the results of strain measurements on a small gelatine model \nthe author concludes that the distribution of the tensile stresses along \nthe horizontal surface is approximately as indicated by the stress area \nbetween the original surface and the plain curve marked u\" (Fig. 140d). \nAt a distance of about H /2 from the upper rim of the vertical face the \ntensile stresses are a maximum. A failure of the bank starts with the \nformation of a tension crack at a distance of about H /2 from the rim \nof the bank. Once the failure has started it proceeds by shear from the \nbottom of the crack to the foot of the bank along a curved surface of \nfailure. \n153.

Rigid boundaries complicate the \ndetermination of the stresses produced in elastic material by mass \nforces such as the force of gravity or the pore-water pressure, and \nmathematical solutions are not yet available for many problems of \npractical importance such as that illustrated by Figure 140d. In such \ncases, the required information can be obtained from small-scale model \ntests. \nThe interpretation of the results of such tests is based on the \nlaws of similitude. These laws are determined by the general equations \nwhich represent the quantities under investigation. For instance, the \nequations of flow nets or the equations representing the distribution of \nthe stresses due to a surcharge on the surface of an elastic solid can \nalways be presented in such a form that the coefficients on one side of \nthe equation are pure numbers. Therefore the quantity on the other \nside of the equation is independent of the scale of the model. \nIf the unknown stresses are due only to gravity or to pore-water \npressures, the law of similitude is very simple, because such stresses \nincrease in direct proportion to the linear dimensions of the body. \nBut the experimental difficulties are very considerable because the",

If an elastic or elastically supported structure, \nsuch as a water tower or a tall building, is temporarily forced out of its \nnormal position by an impact or by the sudden application and removal \nof a force, the elastic forces in the supporting earth and in the members \nof the structure are no longer in equilibrium with the external forces and \nvibrations ensue. The disturbance of the static equilibrium can be \nproduced by earthquakes, explosions, operating machinery, traffic, \npile-driving operations, and many other agents. The amount of dis-\nturbance of the equilibrium produced by a single impulse can be ex-\npressed either by the intensity of the force which causes the disturbance \nor by the distance to which the force removes the center of gravity of \nthe structure from its equilibrium position. The force is called the \ndisturbing force, and the displacement produced by the force is the initial \ndisplacement. \nIf the elastic support of a rigid system is of such a nature that the \nsystem can only vibrate parallel to a given straight line or in a plane \nabout a fixed axis the system is said to have only one degree of freedom. \nOtherwise it has two or more degrees of freedom. \nThe degree of freedom \nis equal to the number of quantities or coordinates which are required \nto define the displacement of the body. In the most general case the \nmovement of a rigid system can be resolved into three translatory and \nthree rotational components. Each one of these components can be \ndefined by a single value. Therefore a rigid system can have no more \nthan six degrees of freedom. Since the relative position of the particles \nof such a system does not change, the system is called a single mass \nsystem. On the other hand if a system consists of several relatively rigid \nbodies which are connected with each other by relatively flexible mem-\nbers one has to deal with a multiple-mass system. \nThe vibrations caused by a single impulse are called free vibration8. \nThe time between two successive arrivals of anyone particle in its \nextreme position in a given direction is the natural period of the vibra-\ntion for this direction. An elastically supported rigid system with a \nsingle degree of freedom has only one natural period. If a system has \nseveral degrees of freedom the natural frequency of the components of \nits free vibrations can be different.",

        "text": "In contrast to the free vibrations produced by a single impulse, the \nvibrations produced by a periodic impulse with an arbitrary period are \ncalled forced vibrations. A periodic impulse can be produced by operat-\ning machined, street traffic, pile-driving operations, and many other \ncauses. If the origin of the periodic impulse is distant from the struc-\nture, the impulse reaches the base of the structure through the subgrade. \nWithin the subgrade the impulse travels like a sound wave. AB time \ngoes on, the distance between the seat of the impulse and the outer \nboundary of the zone which vibrates under the influence of the impulse \nincreases. This outer boundary is the wave front. \nThe velocity with \nwhich the wave front advances represents the velocity of wave propaga-\ntion. Since it depends to a large extent or entirely on the elastic proper-\nties of the subgrade, it is possible to utilize vibration methods for the \npurpose of ascertaining certain elastic properties of the subgrade without \nsampling and testing. \nThe major part of this chapter deals with the influence of the mechan-\nical properties of the soil on the vibrations of superimposed structures \nand the influence of the vibrations on the settlement of the structures. \nTo demonstrate these influences it suffices to consider the rectilinear \nvibrations of single-mass systems with one degree of freedom. \nThe \ntheory of the effect of the vibrations on the structures themselves is \nbeyond the scope of this book. \nIn order to grasp the fundamental principles of the subject it is sufficient to know \nthe theory of undamped free and forced rectilinear vibrations. In order to be able \nto understand the publications dealing with the effect of vibrations on structures and \ntheir foundations the reader also needs a knowledge of the damping effect. \nThe \nmethods of designing engine foundations involve in addition the theory of \nvibrations about a fixed axis of rotation. The theory of undamped vibrations appears \nin the following articles in large print, the theory of damped vibrations in small \nprint and for the theory of vibrations about 8 fixed axis the reader is referred to \ngeneral textbooks, such as Timoshenko (1937).",

According to the theory \nof subgrade reaction (Chapter XVI) the spring bed shown in Figure 141a \nrepresents the mechanical equivalent of a real earth support. In reality \nthe analogy is very incomplete because the value k. for a uniform spring \nbed is independent of the size of the loaded area, whereas the value k. for \nan earth support depends on the size of the loaded area and on several \nother factors which are independent of the elastic properties of the soil \n(see Art. 124). \nHowever, at the time when the theory originated it was generally \nbelieved that k. (eq. 1) was a constant not only for a given spring bed \nbut also for a given soil and that the settlement of a foundation could be \ndetermined if k. was known. Therefore the simple theoretical relation \nexpressed by equation 1 suggested the idea of determining the value of \nthe coefficient of subgrade reaction k. of a given soil by means of a vibra-\ntion test. This can, for instance, be done by placing a thick steel disk \non the surface of the soil, subjecting the disk to a pulsating force with a \nvariable frequency, and measuring the amplitude of the forced vibrations \nproduced by the impulse. The disk and the source of the impulse \ntogether constitute a vibrator. \nAccording to Article 157 the amplitude \nof the vibrator is greatest if the frequency I of the impulse is equal to the \nnatural frequency 10 of the vibrator. \nFrom equation 156(10) we obtain",

In \nreality the system operates rather like a rigid mass with a weight W1 \n(weight of the vibrator) supported by springs with a weight W.. In \norder to get a mC}re-accurate conception of the interaction between the \nvibrator and the supporting soil it is necessary to take into consideration \nthe mass forces which act on the soil located beneath the base of the \nvibrator. This has been accomplished by E. Reissner (1936) on the \nsimplifying assumption that the vibrator rests on the horizontal surface \nof a semi-infinite elastic-isotropic mass. However, no attempt has yet \nbeen made to apply the results of this analysis to the practice of vibrator \ninvestigations. \nIn spite of the inconsistencies in the theoretical concepts on which the \ninterpretation of the test results was based the investigation of soils by \nmeans of vibrators brought out various facts of considerable practical \nimportance. The following is a summary of the results which have been \nobtained to date. \nThe natural frequency of a vibrator with a given weight and a given \nbase area is directly related to the elastic properties of the Bubgrade. \nThe more compact and lesB compressible is the subgrade the greater is \nthe spring constant. Therefore vibrators can be and have been success-\nfully used to determine the relative degree of compaction of artificial \nfills consisting of sandy soil. For similar reasons there is a definite \nrelation between the natural frequency of the vibrator and what is con-\nsidered on the basis of general construction experience the allowable \nbearing value for l'1andy subgrades. The following data abstracted from \nLorenz (1934) illustrate this relationship.",

The bll8e of the vibrator covered an area of 3 square \nfeet. \nAnother set of tests mentioned toward the end of the same paper indicated \nthat W. Wll.'l equal to not more than 1 ton. The weight of the vihrator Wll.'l increll.'led \nfrom 2.0 to 2.7 tons. The area covered by the bll.'le of the vibrator was apparently \nequal to 11 square feet. \nThe soil conditions are not specified. These results seem \nto indicate that the weight W. is likely to vary between wide limits. Since the method \nof computing the weight W. is rather unreliable the results of the investigations can \nonly be used for estimating the extreme values between which W. may range. By \nmeans of these values one computes an upper and lower limit for the value d. of the \ncoefficient of dynamic subgrade reaction. These values represent the statistical \naverage for the upper and lower limit of the value d. of the soil located within the \nseat of the forces of elastic restitution. \nConsidering that the weight W. of the soil \nwhich participates in the vibrations of a vibrator with a base up to 11 square feet \nin area does not exceed about 15 tons the depth of this seat is hardly greater than \nabout 7 feet and it may be considerably less. The elll.'ltic properties of the strata \nlocated at a greater depth have no influence on the test result unless the strata \nare abnormally loose or almost liquid. In order to get information on the elastic \nproperties of stratified deposits with an appreciable depth it is necessary to combine \nthe vibrator method with seismographic observations as described in Article 163. \nIn no case can the results of vibrator tests be used as a basis for computing settlement \ndue to consolidation, because there is no relation between the soil properties revealed \nby the vibrator tests and the coefficient of compressibility ave (eq. 98(1». At the \nvery best the observations can disclose the existence of compressible beds of clay \nbeneath the site, before any borings are made. \nThe value of the damping factor A can be computed by combining equation p \nwith equation 156(13). A value of A in excess of about 3 or 4 sec-1 combined with \nan important settlement of the base of the vibrator is considered an indication of \nhigh compressibility and sensitivity to vibrations (Lorenz 1934). \nThe Degebo vibrators are constructed in such a way that the periodic impulse can \nbe applied either in a vertical or in a horizontal direction. The data obtained while \nsubjecting the vibrator to a horizontal periodic impulse have been used for determin-\ning the coefficient of dynamic subgrade shear reaction dT. \nThis coefficient represents \nthe force per unit of area of the base of the vibrator required to produce a reversible \nhorizontal displacement of this area through a distance equal to unity (Lorenz 1934). \nThis coefficient together with the coefficient d, is used in connection with the compu-\ntation of the natural frequency of engine foundations, described in Article 160.",

The value \ncorresponding to the full-sized foundation is obtained by extrapolation \n(Seismos, no date). On account of the uncertainties involved in this \nprocess the results should be given in the form of a range of values. \nIf the frequency of the impulse exerted by an engine founded on a. \nstratum of sand is within the critical range for the sand, even very \ngentle vibrations are likely to cause important settlement of both the \nfoundation of the engine and of adjacent structures. Everything else \nbeing equal, the settlement increases rapidly with decreasing density \nof the sand. In order to avoid excessive settlement on loose or medium \nsand one should not only provide an ample margin of safety with respect \nto resonance but one should also increase the density of the sand by \nmeans of piles. \nAt present one of the most important motors is the steam turbine. \nIn the early days of steam turbine construction little attention was paid \nto the effect of the inevitable unbalance of the rotating parts until the \nowners complained about foundation defects. At that time the influence \nof the natural frequency of the foundationil on the mechanical effect \nof the disturbing force was not yet appreciated.

Foundations of this type represent the equivalent \nof foundations on a spring support, and the elastic properties of the soil \nhave no bearing on the design. \n161. Waves and wave transmission. The vibrations which have \nbeen discussed in the preceding articles occur in closed systems. If an \nelastically supported system is rigid, all the points of the system pass \nsimultaneously through the equilibrium position, provided it has only \none degree of freedom. \nHowever, in addition to vibrating in itself, the \nsystem represents the center of a vibratory disturbance which proceeds \nlike a sound wave from the center into the sub grade in every radial \ndirection. It imparts to the sub grade the capacity of producing forced \nvibrations in structures resting on the sub grade at a considerable distance \nfrom the center of the disturbance. The event which starts the disturb-\nance is the impulse. \nThe duration of the impulse may be very short, as \nis that of the impulse produced by an explosion or an earthquake. In \nthis case the intensity of the waves produced by the impulse dies out on \naccount of viscous damping. On the other hand a periodic impulse, \nsuch as that produced by operating machines, pile-driving operations, \nor street traffic, maintain a permanent state of vibration. \nThe general characteristics of the waves have been discussed in \nArticle 155. A line which intersects all the consecutive wave fronts at \nright angles is called a line oj wave propagation. \nA particle a on such a \nline (Fig. 148a) starts to vibrate at the instant when the wave front \npasses through the particle. At the time when the particle a has com-\npleted its first cycle with a period ., the wave front has arrived at a \ndistance \n[1]",

        "text": "In a semi-infinite or stratified solid, an impulse can also produce several \nother types of waves. Since these other types of waves travel along and \nparallel to the surface of semi-infinite solids or to the surfaces of discon-\ntinuity in stratified deposits they are called surface wave8. \nThe dis-\nplacements produced by these waves decrease with the distance from the \nsurface. The best-known types of surface waves are the Rayleigh and \nthe Love waves. In a Rayleigh wave the particles vibrate in elliptical \norbits in planes parallel to the direction of wave propagation and at right \nangles to the surface. The Love waves are special types of shear waves. \nAlong the surface of a semi-infinite solid all the surface waves travel \nwith a velocity slightly smaller than that of the shear waves (eq. 3). \nIn relatively thin elastic layers the velocity of certain types of surface \nwaves, including the Love waves, is a function of both the wave length \nand the thickness of the layer. \nThe theory of surface waves has been developed on the basis of the \nassumption that the vibrating medium is perfectly elastic. It can be \nfound in any text book on theoretical seismology, for instance Macelwane \n(1936). A mathematical investigation of the relation between the \namplitude of Rayleigh waves in elastic layers with a finite thickness and \nthe distance from the surface of the layer has been published by \nMarguerre (1933). On account of the simplifying assumptions on \nwhich the theory of surface waves is based and of the complex character \nof these waves the interpretation of the results of field observations \nconcerning surface waves is always somewhat uncertain. \nAt the boundary between two media with different elastic properties \na wave may be reflected back into the medium through which it came \nor it may be refracted, i.e., it may change its direction when entering \nthe second medium. If a particle receives two impulses, for instance \none by a direct wave and a second one by a reflected wave, the resulting \nmotion is equal to the geometric sum of the motions which would be \nproduced by each one of the impulses individually. If the two impulses \nare equal and opposite, the particle remains in a state of rest. These are \ninterference phenomena. \nThe laws which govern the aforementioned phenomena are similar to \nthe laws of reflection, refraction, and interference in optics. A mathe-\nmatical study of the application of these laws to the problems of seismic \nsoil investigations has been published by Ramspeck (Degebo 1936).",

The impact of the hammer on the head of the pile produces \nin the pile a compression wave which travels through the pile toward the \npoint, where it is reflected back into the pile. Since the older theories of \ndynamic pile-driving resistance, described in Article 52, failed to take \nthis phenomenon into consideration they furnished misleading informa-\ntion concerning the influence of the weight of the pile on the effect of the \npile-driving operations. \nThe theories of longitudinal impact on piles are based on the differen-\ntial equation of longitudinal vibrations in bars which in turn is based on \nthe following assumptions. The pile is perfectly elastic, every cross \nsection through the pile remains plane during the process of vibration, \nand the particles of the pile vibrate only in a longitudinal direction, i.e., \nparallel to the axis of the pile. The lateral deformation of the pile is \ndisregarded. In other words it is assumed that Poisson's ratio p. is \nequal to zero. \nLet",

The real pressures will very likely \nbe still lower because the theory on which equation 5 is based disregards the SkiD \nfriction and the existence of a damping force in the pile. Nevertheless, the results \nof the computation justify the conclusion that the greatest pressure produced by \na given impact is greater at the point of the concrete pile than at the point of the \nwooden pile. The approximate validity of the theory on which this conclusion is \nbased has been demonstrated by large-scale tests (Glanville et aI., 1938). As a con-\nsequence of the difference between the maximum pressure at the points of the two \npiles discussed before, the concrete piles should penetrate deeper into the firm stratum \nthan the wooden pile and its static bearing capacity after the pile has been driven \nto refusal should be higher. Yet, according to all those pile formulas which take only \nthe weight of the pile into consideration (see Art. 52) the bearing capacity of the \nwooden pile should be higher than that of the concrete pile provided both piles have \nbeen driven to refusal. This is an example of one of the many erroneous conclusions \nto which the pile formulas may lead. The reasons for the deficiencies of these \nformulas have been discussed in Article 52.",

        "text": "different elastic constants are usually separated by fairly sharp bounda-\nries likely to give rise to well-defined reflection and refraction phenomena. \nTherefore it is theoretically possible to obtain information on the elastic \nproperties and on the thickness of the strata located beneath the surface \nof the earth by recording the vibrations produced by an impulse on the \nsurface at different distances from the focus of the disturbance. Such \nmethods have been used for many years and if the geological conditions \nare favorable, the results are very satisfactory. The impulse is pro-\nduced either by an artificial explosion or by a vibrator. In both methods \nthe vibrations are recorded simultaneously at different distances from \nthe focus of the disturbance by means of portable seismographs. There-\nfore the methods are also called methods of seismic soil exploration. \nIn the explosion methods the impulse is produced by exploding a \nblasting cap or a small charge of dynamite. An impulse of this type \nproduces chiefly compression waves. \nIn a saturated soil the velocity \nof compression waves is much higher than in the same soil in a moist \nstate. Therefore the upper boundary of the zone of capillary saturation \nrepresents a prominent surface of discontinuity with respect to the \nvelocity of propagation of the explosion waves. The seismographs are \nlocated on straight lines through the point of explosion. They record \nboth the instant of the explosion and the subsequent vibrations. In \nexploration to great depth, for instance in salt dome exploration, the \ninterpretation of the seismographic records is based either on the time \nbetween the explosion and the arrival of the first energetic impulse or \non the time which elapses before the waves with a lower velocity arrive. \nWithin a certain distance, whose magnitude depends on the thickness \nof the unconsolidated stratum, the first impulse registered by the \nseismograph is produced by a wave which travels along a fairly straight \nline from the site of the explosion to the receiver. \nBeyond this distance \nthe first energetic impulse is produced by the refracted waves which \ntravel along the path of least resistance at depth. The later ones are \ndue to direct and to reflected waves which travel within the media of \nhigh resistance. Therefore the two methods are known as refraction \nand reflection method respectively (see for instance Leet 1938 or Heiland \n1940).",

The \nwaves produced by the vibrator are chiefly shear waves in the category \nof surface waves. A differentiation of this wave complex into well-\ndefined types such as Rayleigh or Love waves has only been accom-\nplished in a general way. The ground water has no influence on the \nvelocity of shear waves. On the other hand along the boundaries of \nrelatively thin strata the velocity of certain types of surface waves is a. \nfunction of the frequency of the impulse and of the thickness of the \nstratum. However, if the frequency exceeds a certain value, the \nvelocity of these waves is independent of the frequency and becomes \nequal to that of the other surface waves, which is only slightly smaller \nthan the velocity v.

Hence the measured \nvelocities of wave transmission are a measure of the elastic properties \nof the medium through which the wave travels, provided the frequency \nof the impulse has been so chosen that the velocity of all the waves is \nindependent of the frequency.",

Earthquake waves. The mechanics of earthquakes are essen-\ntially identical with those of the vibrations produced by artificial im-\npulses in connection with seismic prospecting (Art. 163). \nAn earthquake may be caused by a sudden slip along fault planes at a \nmoderate depth below the surlace (tectonic earthquake), by explosions \nor other events associated with volcanic activities (volcanic earth-\nquake), or by processes of an unknown nature at great depth below the \nzone in which rocks behave as solids (plutonic earthquakes). The \nzone in which the earthquake originates is called the focus and the point \nor line on the earth's surlace located above the focus is the epicenter. \nIn the vicinity of the epicenter the seismographic instruments usually \nregister in succession the arrival of P, S, and various surlace waves. \nThe surface waves always include Rayleigh waves, Love waves, and \nseveral other types. At a greater distance from the epicenter the \nrecords are still more complex on account of various reflection and \nrefraction phenomena. In every case the earthquake represents a \nperiodic impulse which transfers every object supported by the earth \ninto a state of forced vibrations. Since the intensity of forced vibra-\ntions depends chiefly on the ratio between the natural frequency of \nthe object and the frequency of the impulse, the latter represents a \nfactor of vital importance. Unfortunately the records of earthquake \nvibrations are so complex that they leave a wide margin for inter-\npretation. The vibrations are in every respect similar to those produced \nby quarry blasts. Figure 151 represents a record obtained during and \nafter such a blast (Leet 1939).",

On the other hand, \nif the natural frequency of the structure or of parts of the structure \napproach that of the earthquake vibrations, resonance phenomena are \nlikely to intensify the effect of the periodic impulse to such a degree \nthat the sign of the error associated with the method illustrated by \nFigure 152b is reversed. Such a condition can be anticipated for tall \nbuildings or very high smoke stacks and requires that the method illus-\ntrated by Figure 152b be replaced by another which takes the natural \nfrequency of the structure into consideration. A simple method of \nthis type, applicable to framed structures, has been described by Wester-\ngaard (1933c) and another for tall smoke stacks by Briske (1927). \nThe theoretical investigations in this field have been supplemented \nrepeatedly by laboratory investigations involving measurement of the \nstresses in small-scale models mounted on shaking tables (see for instance \nWilliams 1937, Ruge 1938). \nIn connection with any investigation involving resonance phenomena \nproduced by earthquakes the investigator faces the delicate problem of \nselecting an appropriate value for the frequency of the earthquake \nvibrations. The earthquake shock produces simultaneous vibrations \nwith very different frequencies similar to those produced by a quarry \nblast (see Fig. 151). Therefore the damage to two different structures \nsubject to the same earthquake shock may be due to two entirely differ· \nent components of the same vibration. The one factor in common to \nthe destructive impulse on the two structures is the amount of kinetic \nenergy which is supplied by the earthquake to the foundations per unit \nof time and per unit of volume of the subgrade. Hence, if resonance \nphenomena must be considered it would appear logical to express the \nintensity of the earthquake in terms not of maximum acceleration but \nby the intensity of the flow of energy (Mendenhall 1888). Another \nmethod has recently been suggested by Westergaard (1933b). \nSub· \nstituting a simple harmonic vibration with the amplitude a and the \ncircular frequency w for the real earthquake vibrations we obtain for \nthe distance x of a particle from its equilibrium position at a time. \nfrom equation 156(8) \nx=asinwt \nfor its velocity \ndx \n'V = -\n= awcoswt \ndt",

On rock outcrops the value ng is always \nvery much smaller than on the surface of loose, alluvial fills. \nAn \nalluvial fill which occupies a depression in the surface of the rock repr~ \nsents an elastic unit with well-defined boundaries, having a natural \nfrequency of its own. Therefore the high values of ng for loose surface \ndeposits may represent the result of a resonance phenomenon which \noccurs in the soil before the earthquake waves reach the foundations of \nthe structures. One can visualize this process in the following manner. \nIf the rock extends to the very surface of the earth the greatest part of \nthe kinetic energy which flows toward the surface is reflected and flows \nback again into the rock. On the other hand, if the rock is covered with \na bed of sediments the energy is absorbed by the sediments, a process \ncomparable to the accumulation of kinetic energy in a pendulum acted \nupon by a periodic impulse whose frequency is equal to the natural \nfrequency of the pendulum. This process intensifies the effect of the \nearthquake on structures whose foundations are supported by the sedi-\nments. In the derivation of equation 3, this possibility was not taken \ninto consideration.",
