        "text": "The complexity of ¯ow and wide variety of depositional processes operating in\nsubaqueous density ¯ows, combined with post-depositional consolidation\nand soft-sediment deformation, often make it dif®cult to interpret the\ncharacteristics of the original ¯ow from the sedimentary record. This has led\nto considerable confusion of nomenclature in the literature. This paper\nattempts to clarify this situation by presenting a simple classi®cation of\nsedimentary density ¯ows, based on physical ¯ow properties and grain-\nsupport mechanisms, and brie¯y discusses the likely characteristics of the\ndeposited sediments. Cohesive ¯ows are commonly referred to as debris ¯ows\nand mud ¯ows and de®ned on the basis of sediment characteristics. The\nboundary between cohesive and non-cohesive density ¯ows (frictional ¯ows) is\npoorly constrained, but dimensionless numbers may be of use to de®ne ¯ow\nthresholds. Frictional ¯ows include a continuous series from sediment slides to\nturbidity currents. Subdivision of these ¯ows is made on the basis of the\ndominant particle-support mechanisms, which include matrix strength (in\ncohesive ¯ows), buoyancy, pore pressure, grain-to-grain interaction (causing\ndispersive pressure), Reynolds stresses (turbulence) and bed support (particles\nmoved on the stationary bed). The dominant particle-support mechanism\ndepends upon ¯ow conditions, particle concentration, grain-size distribution\nand particle type. In hyperconcentrated density ¯ows, very high sediment\nconcentrations (>25 volume%) make particle interactions of major importance.\nThe difference between hyperconcentrated density ¯ows and cohesive ¯ows is\nthat\nthe\nformer\nare\nfriction\ndominated.\nWith\ndecreasing\nsediment\nconcentration, vertical particle sorting can result from differential settling,\nand ¯ows in which this can occur are termed concentrated density ¯ows. The\nboundary between hyperconcentrated and concentrated density ¯ows is\nde®ned by a change in particle behaviour, such that denser or larger grains\nare no longer fully supported by grain interaction, thus allowing coarse-grain\ntail (or dense-grain tail) normal grading. The concentration at which this\nchange occurs depends on particle size, sorting, composition and relative\ndensity,\nso\nthat\na\nsingle\nthreshold\nconcentration\ncannot\nbe\nde®ned.\nConcentrated density ¯ows may be highly erosive and subsequently deposit\ncomplete\nor\nincomplete\nLowe\nand\nBouma\nsequences.\nConversely,\nhydroplaning at the base of debris ¯ows, and possibly also in some\nhyperconcentrated ¯ows, may reduce the ¯uid drag, thus allowing high ¯ow\nvelocities while preventing large-scale erosion. Flows with concentrations <9%\nby volume are true turbidity ¯ows (sensu Bagnold, 1962), in which ¯uid\nturbulence is the main particle-support mechanism. Turbidity ¯ows and\nconcentrated density ¯ows can be subdivided on the basis of ¯ow duration into",

Surge-like turbidity currents tend to produce classical Bouma\nsequences, whose nature at any one site depends on factors such as ¯ow\nsize, sediment type and proximity to source. In contrast, quasi-steady turbidity\ncurrents, generated by hyperpycnal river ef¯uent, can deposit coarsening-up\nunits capped by ®ning-up units (because of waxing and waning conditions\nrespectively) and may also include thick units of uniform character (resulting\nfrom prolonged periods of near-steady conditions). Any ¯ow type may\nprogressively change character along the transport path, with transformation\nprimarily\nresulting\nfrom\nreductions\nin sediment\nconcentration\nthrough\nprogressive entrainment of surrounding ¯uid and/or sediment deposition.\nThe rate of ¯uid entrainment, and consequently ¯ow transformation, is\ndependent on factors including slope gradient, lateral con®nement, bed\nroughness, ¯ow thickness and water depth. Flows with high and low\nsediment concentrations may co-exist in one transport event because of\ndown¯ow transformations, ¯ow strati®cation or shear layer development of the\nmixing interface with the overlying water (mixing cloud formation). Deposits\nof an individual ¯ow event at one site may therefore form from a succession\nof different ¯ow types, and this introduces considerable complexity into\nclassifying the ¯ow event or component ¯ow types from the deposits.",

The de®nitive im-\nportance of sediment ¯ows in forming submarine\nsedimentary fans and sediment lobes has been\ndemonstrated through the model of fan growth\ndeveloped by Normark (1970).

        "text": "agreement with Bagnold's observations, de®ned\nturbidity currents as `sediment gravity ¯ows in\nwhich the sediment is supported mainly by the\nupward component of ¯uid turbulence' (Fig. 1).\nDensity ¯ows with such low sediment concen-\ntrations tend to have low competence and cannot\ntransport coarse sand or gravel over any signi®-\ncant distances (kilometres) except on steep slopes\n(over a few degrees). As a consequence, many of\nthe coarse-grained beds that have been called\nturbidites in the literature cannot have been\ndeposited by turbidity currents sensu Middleton\n& Hampton (1973).\nLowe (1982) addressed part of this problem by\nconsidering deposits with distinctly different\ncharacter to Bouma sequences and attributed\nthem to `high-density turbidity currents'. These\nsequences are called Lowe sequences in the\npresent paper. It is unlikely that Lowe sequences\ncan form from true turbidity currents because of\ntheir low sediment concentrations and conse-\nquent low sedimentation rates but, as suggested\nby Lowe (1982), these sequences must have been\ndeposited from ¯ows with higher sediment con-\ncentrations at least near the base of the ¯ow. The\nterm `high-density turbidity current', as Shanmu-\ngam (1996) has pointed out, causes misunder-\nstanding. The term `turbidity current' has been\nused in the literature for ¯ows with sediment\nvolume concentrations up to 45% (e.g. Kuenen,\n1966; Middleton, 1967; Fig. 1). For this range of\nconcentration values far above the Bagnold limit,\n¯uid turbulence does not wholly support all the\nparticles within the ¯ow, and grain-to-grain inter-\naction becomes an increasingly important support\nmechanism (Kneller & Branney, 1995). These\n¯ows are not turbidity currents sensu Middleton\n& Hampton (1973). In an attempt to resolve the\nproblem of terminology and de®nition, Shanmu-\ngam (1996) reclassi®ed deposits previously called\nhigh-density turbidity current deposits (or high-\ndensity turbidites) as sandy debris-¯ow deposits.\nHowever, this rede®nition creates a new problem\nbecause, from a geotechnical (rheological) point of\nview, debris ¯ows are unequivocally cohesive\n¯ows, whereas ¯ows involving relatively non-\ncohesive particles (e.g. sandy ¯ows, debris aval-\nanches) are frictional ¯ows in which cohesion is\nlow. Debris ¯ows and mud ¯ows have been\nde®ned as those ¯ows in which particles of\nvarious sizes (up to boulders several metres in\ndiameter)\nare\ntransported\nbecause\nof\nmatrix\nstrength (e.g. Nardin et al., 1979; Lowe, 1982).\nIverson (1997) considered that the presence of\nhigh pore pressures was a phenomenon that",

They termed these muddy sand-rich ¯ows\n`slurry ¯ows' but used that term in a different way\nfrom that used for subaerial ¯ows (cf.

Only\na few of the ideas presented here are new, and this\npaper pulls together disparate ideas from numer-\nous sources in an attempt to produce a more\nuni®ed\nclassi®cation\nscheme\nfor\nsubaqueous\nsedimentary density ¯ows and their deposits.\nMost natural gravity ¯ows are strati®ed (verti-\ncal variation in sediment concentration, particle\ntype, water density) to some extent because of\nambient ¯uid entrainment and grain settling\n(GarcõÂa & Parker, 1993; GarcõÂa, 1994; Altinakar\net al., 1996). In addition, their character varies in\nthe ¯ow direction (non-uniform) and with time\n(unsteady), so that a single ¯ow may have\ncomponents that are classi®ed differently, and\nthe proportions of those components vary with\ntime.\nConsequently,\nthe\nclassi®cation\nsystem\npresented here may be more useful as a mechan-\nism for focusing thought and aiding teaching and\ndiscussion than as the solution to classifying all\nreal world examples.",

Mesopycnal\n¯ows are particularly important in strongly stra-\nti®ed marine basins where density contrasts\nbetween water layers are large (Rimoldi et al.,\n1996) and in thermally layered lakes (Nemec,\n1995). Density ¯ows that transport large volumes\nof sediment to deep water are probably mostly\nunder¯ows and, consequently, this paper con-\ncentrates on these.

In contrast, frictional (non-cohe-\nsive) ¯ows are made up of discrete particles and\ncan develop high porosity (intergranular space)\nduring ¯ow, which, in subaqueous environments,\nis predominantly ®lled with water. The behaviour\nof frictional ¯ows is thus related directly to the\nrelative proportion of grains and water, which can\nvary greatly during the run-out of a frictional\n¯ow, because there is little or no cohesive force\nbetween grains to prevent water ingress. The\ntransition between sediment slides and sediment\n¯ows, and their classi®cation, have been dis-\ncussed by Mulder & Cochonat (1996).\nThe subdivision of subaqueous frictional ¯ows\nis primarily based on sediment concentration,\nwith\nthree\nmain\nclasses:\nhyperconcentrated\ndensity ¯ows, concentrated density ¯ows and\nturbidity currents. This approach is distinctly\ndifferent from that of Kneller & Buckee (2000),\nwho group all ¯ows `induced by the action of\ngravity upon a (¯uidal) turbid mixture of ¯uid\nand (suspended) sediment, by virtue of the density\ndifference between the mixture and the ambient\n¯uid' as suspension currents. The subdivision of\nfrictional ¯ows is attempted because of observed\nvariations in ¯ow behaviour at differing sediment\nconcentrations (e.g. Hallworth & Huppert, 1998)\nand differing deposit characteristics. The class\nboundaries are\nde®ned on the\nbasis of the\ndominant particle-support mechanism. The term\nhyperconcentrated density ¯ow is preferred to the\nterms `frictional debris ¯ows' or `sandy debris\n¯ows' of Shanmugam (1996) to make a clear\ndistinction from the term `cohesive debris ¯ow'.\nAs a consequence, the term `debris ¯ow' can be\nused synonymously for `cohesive debris ¯ow'\n(Fig. 3). Hyperconcentrated density ¯ows may\ntransform into concentrated density ¯ows and\nturbidity ¯ows, as there is no proven gap between\nthe sediment concentration ranges of the three\ntypes of frictional ¯ow.\nThe Bagnold limit for turbulent suspension\n(C  9%) is used to separate turbidity ¯ows sensu\nstricto from concentrated density ¯ows. Accurate\napplication of the Bagnold limit may be dif®cult\n(or impossible) in the ®eld because of the uncer-\ntainty regarding the nature of deposits from ¯ows\non either side of the limit and the continuum of\n¯ow behaviour. It is possible that sediment will\nmove differently during emplacement on the bed,\nand so grain fabric in the deposits might vary, but\nthis has yet to be studied experimentally. At the\nmoment, it is only possible to infer that deposits",

Fig. 4), rather than the only\nsupport mechanism (turbidity currents sensu\nstricto), on the basis of grain size and sedimentary\nstructures (e.g. ripple cross-lamination; cf. Lowe,\n1988). Well-developed normal vertical grading\nmay be typical of suspension deposits from a\nturbulence-dominated ¯ow. This classi®cation\nboundary therefore highlights a scienti®c question\nthat has not been addressed, although the out-\ncome has been assumed in earlier classi®cations:\nis there a difference in the deposits across the\nthreshold where grain interaction starts?\nThe boundary distinction between hypercon-\ncentrated and concentrated density ¯ows is dif®-\ncult to de®ne for either the ¯ows or the deposits.\nAs with turbidity ¯ows and concentrated density\n¯ows, the boundary should be based on a physical\nthreshold related to particle support. Such a\nthreshold is likely to correlate with a change\nin deposit character, although in the deposits\ndepositional features may be overprinted by\npost-depositional features such as soft-sediment\ndeformation structures that make classi®cation of\n¯ow type impossible. The boundary proposed\nhere is a threshold of sediment concentration\nwhen particle sorting can occur freely by particle\nsettling during the passage of the ¯ow. This\nboundary is close to, but may not be identical\nwith, the transition between Newtonian and non-\nNewtonian conditions. There is little or no normal\ngrading\nin\nhyperconcentrated\n¯ow\ndeposits\nexcept at the very top of the deposit where\ndeposition occurs from the more dilute mixing\ncloud. Julien & Lan (1991) showed that the\nrheology of hyperconcentrated ¯ows depends\nnot only on the particle concentration but also\non the densities of the ¯uid and solid particles and\nparticle size. Consequently, a single concentration\nis not easily de®nable as the boundary (see Fig. 1).\nThis classi®cation includes a wide range (con-\ntinuum) of ¯ow types within the concentrated\ndensity ¯ow category. Many deposits can be\ncon®dently interpreted as derived from concen-\ntrated density ¯ows (cf. the high density currents\ndescribed by Lowe, 1982), and this overcomes the\nmisunderstanding that arises from earlier classi-\n®cations using the terms `high density' and\n`turbidity' when density and sediment concen-\ntration were unknown and ¯uid turbulence was\nnot the major support mechanism. The processes\nof deposition in concentrated density ¯ows, and\nthe nature of the resulting deposits, are poorly\nunderstood. For example, the stability ®elds of",

Middleton & Southard,\n1984).\nSteady turbulent ¯ow occurs when the mean\nvelocity at a point remains unchanged over a\nspeci®ed time period. In reality, all natural\nsediment density ¯ows are unsteady but, in some\nsituations, mean velocity may be nearly constant\nfor a period of hours to days. Consequently,\nturbidity ¯ows can be subdivided further into\nshort-duration surges and surge-like ¯ows, in\nwhich the behaviour of the head of the ¯ow is of\nprimary importance, and more prolonged turbid-\nity currents (quasi-steady ¯ows), when behaviour\nof the ¯ow head is of minor importance to deposit\ncharacter compared with processes occurring in\nthe body of the ¯ow. The distinction of duration\nis as yet unclear and presents another signi®cant\nscienti®c question that should be addressed.\nThe threshold of duration cannot be stated as a\nsingle value, as the boundary must depend on the\nmagnitude of the ¯ow. Duration at a point in a\nsmall\nsurge\nor\nsurge-like\n¯ow\n(thickness\nof\ncentimetres to metres) may be seconds to minutes,\nwhereas in large oceanic surge-like ¯ows (scale of\ntens to hundreds of metres), it may be hours (e.g.\nGrand Banks event over 9 h; Hughes-Clarke et al.,\n1990). There is no consensus as to what sedimen-\ntary features are the result of the head or body of a\n¯ow and, hence, what proportions of features\nresult from formation by the ¯ow head. Conse-\nquently,\nexact\nclassi®cation\nis\nnot\ncurrently\npossible. The steadiness of ¯ow also has major\nconsequences for deposit character (cf. Kneller,\n1995). The division into quasi-steady and surge-\nlike ¯ows is also applicable to concentrated\ndensity ¯ows and, theoretically, to hyperconcen-\ntrated density ¯ows, although this would require\nunusually extreme situations such as prolonged\nlahars discharging into tranquil water. Kneller &\nBranney (1995) used the concept of sustained\nhigh-density ¯ows to explain deposits of thick\nmassive sand, and such ¯ows would be quasi-\nsteady in the present classi®cation.\nThe erosion, deposition and behaviour of each\nof the main ¯ow types de®ned in this classi®ca-\ntion are reviewed below and related to the\ncharacteristics of the sediments. In any of these\ntypes of density ¯ows, ¯ow conditions can vary\n(in\nspace\nand\ntime)\nbetween\nwaxing\n(mean",

Bagnold showed that collisional stresses\ndominate viscous stresses if the Bagnold number\nis greater than »200 (for an in®nite value of the\nSavage number). Savage & Hutter's (1989) experi-\nments demonstrated that grain collision stresses\ndominate grain friction stresses in dry granular\n¯ows (so the ¯ow becomes a grain ¯ow) if the\nSavage number is >0á1. Above a Bagnold number\nof 200±450, the ¯ow becomes a more dilute ¯ow\n(hyperconcentrated, concentrated ¯ow or turbid-\nity current). This is consistent with a critical\nvalue of 2000 (200/0á1) for the friction number\nseparating cohesive debris ¯ows from grain ¯ows\nin\nsubaerial\nconditions\n(Iverson,\n1997).\nThe\nReynolds number is always below 100 (laminar\nconditions) in these ¯ows. According to the\nde®nition of the mass number, grain inertia\nbecomes negligible when the density or concen-\ntration of grains is close to zero. If concentration\ndecreases, the ¯ow is no longer a debris ¯ow, thus\njustifying the classi®cation based, in part, on\ngrain concentration or density. Iverson & LaHu-\nsen (1989) described experimental debris ¯ows\nwith Darcy numbers in the range 1000±6000, in\nwhich large ¯uid pressure ¯uctuations are evi-\ndence of strong solid±¯uid interactions, consis-\ntent with excess pore pressure being the main\ntriggering factor in subaerial conditions.\nIn submarine environments, sediment is always\nsaturated, buoyancy is an important phenomenon\nand the critical values of dimensionless numbers,\nparticularly the Darcy number, may vary from\nthose found in subaerial environments. However,\nit is evident that for a debris ¯ow, according to the\nde®nition above, the friction number must be low\nand the ¯ow regime laminar.\nCohesion and viscosity are not directly related.\nIn subaqueous settings, the interstitial water is\ngenerally of the same or lower density than the\nambient water and, consequently, unlike subae-\nrial settings, the water within the ¯ow supplies\nno driving density to the ¯ow and, because\nsurface tension is inactive, the interstitial water\ndoes not act to hold the ¯ow together at all.\nConsequently, the difference between cohesion\nand\nviscosity\nbecomes\nmore\nimportant,\nand\nsubaqueous and subaerial debris ¯ows cannot be\nde®ned in the same way.

Liquefaction\n(Elverhoi et al., 1997; Major & Iverson, 1999) and\ngrain interaction may also be locally important\n(Pierson, 1981; Iverson et al., 1997; Major &\nIverson, 1999). Hampton's (1975) experiments\nsuggested that matrix strength is capable of fully\nsupporting particles up to coarse sand grade.\nThere\nare\nnumerous\nexamples,\nhowever,\nof\ndebris ¯ows transporting decametre-scale blocks\n(Johnson, 1970, 1984; Rodine & Johnson, 1976;\nLeigh & Hartley, 1992; van Weering et al., 1998).\nLarger clasts can be supported by high local pore\npressures (Ineson, 1985), buoyancy and clast-to-\nclast interaction (Pierson, 1981). As cohesion is\nthe de®ning attribute of these ¯ows, some may\ninclude relatively little sand.\nCohesive density ¯ows can be divided into\nmud ¯ows and debris ¯ows on the basis of the\nsediment size sorting. The classi®cation of poorly\nsorted sedimentary rocks depends on the per-\ncentage of gravel-grade sediment and the relative\namounts of sand and mud (Folk, 1954; Moncrieff,\n1989). The chosen boundaries in these classi®ca-\ntions are arbitrary but, for consistency, distinction\nbetween mud ¯ows and debris ¯ows can follow\nsimilar boundaries. Consequently, assuming that\nthere is no loss of sediment during or after\ndeposition, mud-¯ow deposits may be mudstones,\nmudstones\nwith\ndispersed\nclasts,\nclast-poor\ndiamictite, sandy mudstones or sandy mudstones\nwith dispersed clasts. Thus, mud ¯ow deposits\nhave less than 5% gravel by volume and a ratio of\nmud to sand of more than 1:1. Mud ¯ows\ntransport (and so deposit) little or no coarse\nsediment, although they may transport isolated\nlarge blocks. Mud ¯ows can be further subdivided\non the basis of the proportion of silt and clay\naccording to the engineering description of mud-\nrocks (Hawkins & Pinches, 1992), such that ¯ows\nwith <25% clay might be called silty mud ¯ows\nand those with >40% clay may be classed as clay-\nrich mud ¯ows. Debris ¯ows consist of more\npoorly sorted sediment (>5% gravel with variable\nsand proportion) and may transport boulder-sized\nclasts of soft sediment or rock and very large rafts\nor olistoliths (Johnson, 1970, 1984; Rodine &",

Even\nthough they can travel rapidly (comparable sub-\naerial ¯ows reach speeds of several metres per\nsecond; Middleton & Southard, 1984), subaqu-\neous debris ¯ows generally appear to be only\nslightly erosional (cf. Pickering et al., 1989; Gee\net al., 1999). The small amount of erosion and fast\nspeed has been explained by a water layer being\npinched under the ¯ow snout and reducing the\nresistance due to drag on the ¯oor (Iverson, 1997),\nthus reducing erosion: this process has been\nnamed hydroplaning (Mohrig et al., 1998, 1999).\nGee et al. (1999) explained the long run-out\ndistance (700 km) of the Saharan debris ¯ow by\ninvoking a two-phase ¯ow with a relatively\nimpermeable upper layer overpressuring a lower,\nless cohesive (more mobile) layer.\nDebris ¯ows may undergo transformation dur-\ning ¯ow, but such transformations are poorly\nunderstood\n(Hampton,\n1972;\nWeirich,\n1988).\nFlow transformations have been observed in\nsubaerial settings (e.g. Pierson & Scott, 1985;\nVallance & Scott, 1997), inferred from the depos-\nits of subaqueous events (e.g. Piper et al., 1985,\n1992, 1999a) and observed in a small arti®cial\nlake (Weirich, 1988). Debris ¯ows may transform\npartially or totally into sediment-driven, particu-\nlate\n¯ows.\nFlow\ntransformation\nmay\noccur\nthrough mixing and dilution at the head (Hamp-\nton, 1972), entrainment at the upper boundary of\nthe body or by passage through a hydraulic jump\n(Fisher, 1983; Weirich, 1988). Mixing at the upper\nboundary may also generate frictional ¯ows. This\nis shown, for example, in a photograph of a\nlaboratory subaqueous debris ¯ow that has a\nmixing cloud above it (Fig. 1 in Mohrig et al.,\n1999). Flow transformation has been suggested to\nexplain several ocean-¯oor features such as those\nassociated with the 1929 Grand Banks event\n(Piper et al., 1985, 1999b), Quaternary features\non the Scotian Slope (Piper et al., 1992) and\nMadeira Abyssal Plain (Rothwell et al., 1992).\nDebris ¯ows are more likely to transform into\nhyperconcentrated density ¯ows or concentrated\ndensity ¯ows if they contain high proportions of\nparticles larger than medium silt (cf. Hampton,\n1972, 1975).\nThe main process for debris-¯ow deposition is\nfreezing or en masse deposition of the ¯ow\n(Lowe, 1982; Postma, 1986) or parts of the ¯ow.\nWhen the force related to the shear resistance of",

Such stream-\ngenerated hyperconcentrated ¯ows occur in small\nbasins with shallow water depths, particularly in\ntectonically active settings (Mutti et al., 1996). In\nthis setting, small steep ramps allow transport of\nblocks close to the bottom, but ramps are too short\nto allow a full transformation of the ¯ow into a\nturbidity current. These ¯ows may result in the\nprogradation of small alluvial fans (cf. Mutti\net al., 1996; Falk & Dorsey, 1998). Hyperconcen-\ntrated density ¯ows may also be generated at\nice-sheet margins where subglacial or englacial\nchannels debouch into deep water where such\n¯ows may be quasi-steady (cf. Plink-BjoÈrklund &\nRonnert, 1999).\nThe proportion of cohesive and non-cohesive\nparticles that de®ne the threshold between cohe-\nsive and frictional behaviour is not well known\nfor subaqueous ¯ow and varies depending on\n¯ow conditions and concentration (cf. Fisher,\n1971; Iverson, 1997). Shanmugam (1996, 1997)\nsuggested that a sand proportion greater than\nabout 25±30% by volume may be required. Sandy\nsediment can move as a debris ¯ow with as little\nas 2% by volume clay content if the sand is ®ne\ngrained and 19% by volume if the sand is coarse\ngrained (Hampton, 1975). Coussot (1992) sugges-\nted that a clay content of 4±10% by volume would\ncause a subaerial poorly sorted mixture to behave\nas a viscoplastic ¯uid regardless of the maximum\nparticle size. It has been suggested that debris\n¯ows can transform to non-cohesive ¯ows with\nno change in water content or clay fraction when\nthe velocity is high enough (Fisher, 1983) and, as\nsuggested by Middleton & Southard (1984), the\nreverse\ntransformation\nmay\nalso\nbe\npossible\nwhere deceleration or dewatering of a hypercon-\ncentrated ¯ow generates a debris ¯ow (cf. the\nmatrix strength-modi®ed grain-¯ow deposits of\nPlink-BjoÈrklund & Ronnert, 1999). Such a trans-\nition has been observed in subaerial conditions\n(cf. Plafker & Ericksen, 1978\n1\n) but has not yet been\ndocumented in subaqueous settings.\nThe character of these frictional ¯ows depends\non the proportion of cohesive and non-cohesive\nparticles, water content and ¯ow velocity.

Such ¯ows generally require a relatively\nsteep slope to travel any signi®cant distance and\nmay form signi®cant volumes of deposits where\nclean sand is supplied to submarine canyon\nheads, as in the Campos Basin of SE Brazil (Viana\n& FaugeÁres, 1998\n2\n).\nThe presence of some cohesive grains may\nmake the generation and maintenance of hyper-\nconcentrated ¯ows easier, as the rate of pore\npressure dissipation is reduced and coherence of\nthe ¯ow body is encouraged. Such ¯ows, with\nsome internal cohesion, may be more common,\nlarger and travel further than grain ¯ows in which\ngrain interaction is predominantly non-cohesive.\nFlows of this type may include the slurry ¯ows\ndiscussed by Lowe & Guy (2000). This behaviour\nand relationship with clay content may be similar\nto that reported in lahars (Vallance, 2000).\nLiquefaction is a common triggering mechan-\nism for hyperconcentrated density ¯ows and is\nconsidered the most frequent mechanism for\ntriggering subaerial debris ¯ows (Iverson, 1997).\nLiquefaction occurs when the effective resistance\nof the granular material is reduced to zero by an\nincrease in internal pore pressure. This increase\nin pore pressure can be caused by storm wave\nloading in shallow water depths (e.g. in deltaic\nenvironments; Prior et al., 1989) or when sand is\nsubmitted to seismic shaking. In the latter case,\nsediment strength is reduced by an increase in\npore pressure and the generation of ground\nacceleration. Liquefaction can also be generated\nby high sedimentation rates occurring, for exam-\nple, at river mouths (Bornhold et al., 1994) or by\ntidal lowering during equinox tide conditions\n(Bjerrum, 1971). Particles in lique®ed sediment\nare supported by the upward force of ¯uid\npressure (reducing friction), and the sediment\nbody has little resistance to downslope move-\nment.

The basal water layer is\npressurized by the mass of the upper layer. Such\n¯ow behaviour reduces drag at the base of the\n¯ow over its full length and encourages hydro-\nplaning (Mohrig et al., 1998), generating high-\nvelocity ¯ows with little basal erosion.\nThe presence\nof connected\nvoids between\ngrains enables hyperconcentrated density ¯ows\nto ingest water, expand and so transform into less\nconcentrated density ¯ows (and, consequently,\nsubaqueous ¯ow transformation may be very\ndifferent from subaerial equivalents). With few\ncohesive particles, turbulence generation is relat-\nively easy (Kneller & Buckee, 2000), and trans-\nformation may be triggered by ¯ow over changing\ntopography, resulting in a concentrated density\n¯ow or even a turbidity ¯ow or both (cf. Fisher,\n1983).\nFlow\ntransitions\nare\nassociated\nwith\nchanging\nparticle-support\nmechanisms\nwith\nincreasing ¯uid turbulent support (Fig. 4). Such\ntransformations may be similar to those observed\nin lahars running down river valleys, where\nprogressive ingress of water at the head dilutes the\nmixture, losing the capacity to carry larger gravel\n(Vallance, 2000). However, in subaqueous ¯ows,\ndilution may also occur along the upper surface\n(as shown in a photograph of Taira's experiment\npresented by Simpson, 1997, ®g. 16.5, p. 222).\nThe driving force of hyperconcentrated density\n¯ows is mostly related to gravity. Although run-\nout distance depends on many factors, such ¯ows\ncannot be maintained on very-low-angle slopes\nfor as long as more dilute ¯ows. The main\nmechanism for deposition from hyperconcent-\nrated ¯ows is frictional freezing resulting from\ngrain-to-grain\ninteraction.\nMajor\n(1997)\nused\nlarge-scale subaerial experiments to show that\ndeposition from granular (frictional) ¯ows was\nquite different from that from cohesive ¯ows.\nEffectively, en masse freezing does not occur.\nDeposition proceeds by the accretion of succes-\nsive small-scale ¯ow surges to the top of previous\nlayers. Transport and segregation of large clasts is\neasier than in cohesive ¯ows because upward\nmovement of particles is not prevented by a\ncohesive matrix. Rafting is common and can\ntransport large blocks over considerable distan-\nces.

If velocity is high\nenough, entrainment of sea water progressively\ndecreases the sediment concentration, despite\nerosion, and the ¯ow is prevented from freezing.\nWith decreasing sediment concentration, ¯uid\nturbulence progressively replaces grain-to-grain\ninteraction as the main particle-support mechan-\nism (as represented in Fig. 4). By de®nition, in\nconcentrated density ¯ows, the upward compo-\nnent of ¯uid turbulence can only contribute part\nof the sediment-support mechanism for the sedi-\nment load of the ¯ow as a whole (Fig. 4).\nAlthough grain-to-grain interaction remains the\ndominant particle-support mechanism through-\nout the total range of concentrated density ¯ows,\n¯uid turbulence may act as the main grain-\nsupport mechanism near the top of the ¯ow and\nat the ¯ow head (i.e. where entrainment of\nsurrounding ¯uid occurs; Laval, 1988; Laval\net al., 1988). Such ¯ows may be regarded as\ntransitional ¯ows, in that the whole ¯ow does not\n®t within one ¯ow-type class.\nThe base of the ¯ow, in some cases, may be\ncharacterized by an intense near-bed transport of\ncoarse particles (gravel and coarse sand) forming\na traction load. Very close to the bed, particle\nconcentration is far above the Bagnold limit, and\nthis part of the ¯ow may behave in a similar way\nto\nsome\nhyperconcentrated\ndensity\n¯ows,\nalthough additional shear is supplied from the\nover-riding concentrated density ¯ow. In con-\ntrast, at the top of the ¯ow, entrainment and the\ndevelopment of a mixing cloud leads to a region\nwith\nlow\nsediment\nconcentration\n(dropping\nbelow the Bagnold limit), and turbulent particle\nsupport dominates. In this way, concentrated\ndensity ¯ows may become strati®ed. The compo-\nnent layers have different dominant sediment-\nsupport mechanisms and may decouple (cf. ¯ow\nsplitting or ¯ow stripping; Piper & Normark,\n1983; Masson, 1994) to generate ¯ows of different\ncharacter (sediment load characteristics) from the\noriginal ¯ow that may be classi®ed differently\nfrom each other.\nThe deposits of concentrated density ¯ows may\nhave an erosional base overlain by massive sand\nor gravel as illustrated in Fig. 6 (cf. Ta Bouma or\nLowe sequences).\nUnder highly\nconcentrated\nbasal\nlayers,\ninversely\ngraded\ndeposits\nmay\ndevelop (Lowe, 1982; Hiscott, 1994, 1995; Sohn,\n1995, 1997, 1999). Such layers have been des-\ncribed from ancient deposits and range in char-\nacter from individual thin (<1 cm) layers to\nthicker (>10 cm) gravelly layers to repeated 1- to",

Fig. 4), they often travel over\nlower slope angles than the associated more\nconcentrated ¯ows. For example, in the 1979\nNice event, the ¯ow-slide travelled down steep\ncanyon slopes (>15°), the concentrated density\n¯ow continued down slopes of 3° for at least\n40 km from the original failure, and the ®nal part\nof the travel path, representing another 140 km,\nwas probably a true turbulent suspension ¯ow.\nOn the\nlobe,\nthe ¯ow\n®nally ¯attened and\nreconcentrated to become a new concentrated\n¯ow (Unterseh, 1999). Surges and surge-like\nturbidity ¯ows (when not co-existing with a basal\nconcentrated density ¯ow) are mainly deposi-\ntional. These ¯ows do not usually transport\nparticles with grain sizes larger than sand, unless\nthey are of low density such as animal tests (cf.\nMorris et al., 1998). Particles are maintained in\nsuspension as a result of the upward component\nof turbulence and settle gently, with some move-\nment\nalong\nthe\nbed,\nproducing\nsedimentary\nstructures and bedforms of typical Bouma Tb±d.\nIf particles are sand grade, ¯ow may reconcentrate\nand form a concentrated sheet ¯ow spreading\nalong the base as a lobe (leading perhaps to\ntransitional deposits as shown in Fig. 7B). Ero-\nsion can be produced at the base of turbidity\n¯ows when the ¯ow is reaccelerated. Reacceler-\nation can occur with an increase in slope, for\nexample when a current ¯ows over a levee\n(Migeon,\n1997;\nFig. 7A)\nor\nwhen\na\nchannel\nnarrows.\nSurges and shorter duration surge-like ¯ows are\nvery-short-duration events; hence, variation in\ndepositional\nconditions\nwith\ntime\nmay\nnot\nalways be appreciated from their deposits. These\n¯ows are similar to powder snow avalanches and\ncarry a small amount of sediment in relation to\nthe total ¯ow volume. Individually, surges and\nshorter duration surge-like ¯ows will not produce\nthick deposits unless the ¯ow magnitude is very\nlarge or ¯ow is ponded (cf. Rothwell et al., 1992)\nand, even then, the bed thickness is relatively\nsmall compared with the ¯ow size (small ratio of\nbed thickness to bed length).

As a consequence of the lower sediment\nconcentrations, assuming the same ambient ¯uid,\nhyperpycnal turbidity currents generally have\nlower velocities than other ¯ow types.\nA major difference between quasi-steady ¯ows\nand surge-like\n¯ows\nis the\nduration of the\nphenomena relative to its magnitude. The dur-\nation of a surge-like ¯ow can be a few tens of\nhours in a rare large event, taking into account the\nperiod from the initial slide to ®nal deposition in\nthe most distal part (cf. Hughes-Clarke et al.,\n1990). For an observer located at a particular\npoint, the event lasts a few hours at most if the\ncurrent\nresults\nfrom\ncontinuous\nretrogressive\nslides, and the ¯ow is strongly unsteady. In\ncontrast, a quasi-steady turbidity current can\npersist for several days or weeks, depending on\nthe ¯ood duration at the river mouth (Skene et al.,\n1997; Mulder et al., 1998). To an observer at a\nparticular point, the phenomenon appears to be\nsteady for a prolonged period, particularly if the\n¯ood hydrograph rises and falls gradually. The\n¯ow may be uniform or non-uniform over a long\ndistance, depending on the slope and initial\nmomentum (e.g. Fig. 8).\nUnfortunately, this ¯ow type has been little\nstudied, and so interpretation of ancient deposits\nis very dif®cult. A few studies have examined\narti®cial quasi-steady turbidity currents where,\nfor example, mine tailings are discharged into the\nsea (e.g. Hay, 1987; Normark, 1989). There are a\nfew studies that have suggested hyperpycnal\nturbidity currents as an explanation for observed\ndeposits (e.g. Nemec, 1995; Piper et al., 1999a),\nbut diagnostic criteria for their identi®cation have\nnot been established.\nDuring the rise of a ¯ood, the rate of velocity\nincrease at a river mouth depends on the origin\nof the ¯ood (storm, monsoon and prolonged\nrainfalls), rainfall pattern and catchment beha-\nviour (rating coef®cient). If the near-shore slope is\nrelatively steep or if the ¯ow is channelled\n(lateral ¯ow restriction), the ¯ow is accumulative\n(Kneller, 1995) and reworks its own deposits\n(Fig. 9B and C). In the case of a ¯ash ¯ood,\ninsigni®cant deposition occurs in areas where the\n¯ow is waxing because the initial velocity increa-\nses quickly and deposits are immediately re-\nworked. Once past the base-of-slope or where the\n¯ow is no longer channelled, the ¯ow becomes\ndepletive and almost steady because the increase\nin initial velocity at the river mouth is attenuated.\nIn these sites, sediments then can be deposited",

The deposits range from\ninversely graded units overlain by a normally\ngraded sequence, through a similar sequence but\nwith a thick uniform grain-size interval (resulting\nfrom steady conditions) to various sequences in\nwhich the inversely graded unit is partly or\ntotally eroded before deposition of a normally\ngraded unit (cf. Fig. 9). Increasing amounts of\nwithin-bed\nerosion\n(partial\nremoval\nor\ntotal\nremoval of inversely graded units) occur in\nproximal positions (Skene et al., 1997; Mulder\net al., 1998).\nIt might be possible to recognize quasi-steady\nturbidity current deposits by a coarsening-up unit\nfollowed by a ®ning-up unit separated by a sharp\ncontact or erosional surface, at least in proximal\nareas (cf. the Saguenay turbidite; Mulder et al.,\n1998). Depending on the magnitude of the ¯ood,\nthe inversely graded part of the turbidite may not\nbe preserved in the most proximal area. Intense\nerosion in the proximal part of the plume during\nthe rising limb of a ¯ood may affect the overall\nshape of the deposits and, if the deposit is thick\nenough, might be an important feature for the\nrecognition of quasi-steady turbidites on seismic\nre¯ection pro®les. If little erosion occurs in\nproximal areas while deposition is occurring in\nmore distal regions of a hyperpycnal turbidity\ncurrent, the resulting deposits are likely to have a\ngently concave-up shape (Fig. 9A). When erosion\noccurs, some of the proximal parts of the deposit\ntend to be removed and redeposited seawards; the\namplitude of erosion decreases seawards. In cases\nin which erosion is intense, deposits are convex-\nup (bell-shaped, Fig. 9C) as exempli®ed by the\nSaguenay turbidite (Mulder et al., 1998).\nThe Saguenay turbidite includes an inversely\ngraded unit capped by a normally graded unit in\nthe distal part. The inversely graded part of the\nSaguenay turbidite and other similar deposits is\nusually thinner than the normally graded part\nbecause (1) it involves only the coarser sediment\nfraction; (2) it may have been eroded, or partly\neroded, during peak ¯ood conditions; and (3) the",

Climbing ripples may be a major sedimen-\ntary feature of hyperpycnal turbidites, as they\nrepresent the steady migration of sedimentary\nbedforms while sediment supply is maintained\nand\nsedimentation\nrate\nis\nsigni®cant.\nWhen\nsediment load decreases, climbing ripples can\nbe\nreplaced\nby\nclassical\nasymmetric\nripples\nproducing cross-lamination. Dunes will be less\ncommon, as the conditions favourable for their\nformation may be maintained for a shorter time,\nand bigger bedforms take longer to develop.\nClimbing ripples have been observed in in-\nversely graded units that are capped by normally\ngraded\nunits\nin\nthe\nVar\nsedimentary\nridge\n(Migeon,\n1997),\nwhere\nhyperpycnal\nturbidity\ncurrents are expected to be frequent (Mulder\net al., 1997b). The low sediment concentration\nin\nhyperpycnal\nturbidity\ncurrents\ncompared\nwith most of the rest of the sediment-driven\n¯ows described in this paper, and consequent\nlow velocities, allow large volumes of ¯uid\nentrainment over short distances and vertical\n¯ow expansion. As a result, hyperpycnal tur-\nbidity currents can become very thick ¯ows, and\nthis may be one explanation for the discovery of\n`turbidites' on topographic highs, such as on\nlevee tops bordering submarine canyons (Piper &\nSavoye,\n1993)\ndownstream\nof\nriver\nmouths\nwhere hyperpycnal plumes are suspected to be\ngenerated with a high frequency, such as in the\nVar Canyon (Mulder et al., 1997b).\nHyperpycnal turbidity currents generated at\nriver mouths transport sediment directly from\nthe continent towards the ocean. Consequently,\nboth the volume and the origin of organic matter\nmay be different from those found in other\nsettings: deposits may contain few marine taxa\nand are likely to contain large percentages of\nallochthonous freshwater fossils.\nGiven the frequency of their formation, hyper-\npycnal turbidites are probably very common,\nalthough they are not commonly recorded in the\nliterature. Misidenti®cation could occur for two\nreasons: (1) lack of the basal inversely graded unit\nas a result of erosion or bypass and their conse-\nquent misinterpretation in terms of classical\nBouma-type sequences that are related to surge-\nlike turbidity ¯ows; and (2) interpretation as two",

        "text": "subaerial and subaqueous conditions, these\ndimensionless numbers may be useful for the\ninvestigation of ¯ow thresholds.\n2 The threshold between hyperconcentrated and\nconcentrated density ¯ow is based on the\ntransition from conditions in which differen-\ntial particle settling may occur freely within\nthe ¯ow. The transition depends on particle\nconcentration and probably also on grain size\ndistribution and viscosity, although their ef-\nfects are as yet poorly de®ned. The boundary\nbetween hyperconcentrated and concentrated\ndensity ¯ow may be near the transition from\nnon-Newtonian to Newtonian behaviour.\n3 Using Bagnold's limit to de®ne turbidity ¯ows\nis satisfactory but, as there is probably a\ncontinuous range from ¯ows with a ¯uid\nturbulent\nsediment\nsupport\nto\nthose\nwith\ngrain-to-grain support, and these may occur\nin different areas of the same ¯ow, application\nof this de®nition is dif®cult. Additionally, as\nthe difference in characteristics of deposits\nacross the Bagnold limit is unknown, it is best\nto de®ne turbidity currents (sensu lato) as\n¯ows in which particle support by ¯uid turbu-\nlence is dominant, rather than being the only\nmechanism.\n4 Turbidity ¯ows and concentrated density ¯ows\ncan be subdivided into surges, surge-like tur-\nbidity currents and quasi-steady turbidity cur-\nrents. This distinction is compatible with the\ndifference between ¯ows generated by trans-\nition from other density ¯ows or by collapse of\nsuspension clouds (e.g. storm generated) and\nthose currents caused by sustained suspended-\nsediment-charged ¯uvial discharge.\n5 Surge-like\nturbidity\n¯ows\ngenerate\ntypical\nBouma sequences, whereas quasi-steady tur-\nbidity currents are relatively long duration,\nsteady ¯ows and may produce a range of\nsequences\nthat\ntypically\ncomprise\na\nbasal\ncoarsening-up\nunit\ncapped\nby\na\n®ning-up\nBouma-like unit. An erosional surface or a\nsharp contact may separate the coarsening-up\nand ®ning-up units and may locally remove the\nentire bottom unit. At locations where the ¯ow\nis both steady and depletive, thick units of\nuniform character can be deposited, and climb-\ning ripples may develop.",
