Here, we summarize current knowledge of\nsuch landslides and the problems of assessing their hazard potential. The major hazards\nrelated to submarine landslides include destruction of seabed infrastructure, collapse of\ncoastal areas into the sea and landslide-generated tsunamis. Most submarine slopes are\ninherently stable. Elevated pore pressures (leading to decreased frictional resistance to\nsliding) and speciﬁc weak layers within stratiﬁed sequences appear to be the key factors\ninﬂuencing landslide occurrence. Elevated pore pressures can result from normal\ndepositional processes or from transient processes such as earthquake shaking; historical\nevidence suggests that the majority of large submarine landslides are triggered by\nearthquakes. Because of their tsunamigenic potential, ocean-island ﬂank collapses and\nrockslides in fjords have been identiﬁed as the most dangerous of all landslide related\nhazards. Published models of ocean-island landslides mainly examine ‘worst-case\nscenarios’ that have a low probability of occurrence. Areas prone to submarine\nlandsliding are relatively easy to identify, but we are still some way from being able to\nforecast individual events with precision. Monitoring of critical areas where landslides\nmight be imminent and modelling landslide consequences so that appropriate mitigation\nstrategies can be developed would appear to be areas where advances on current practice\nare possible.",

The\nhuman consequences can be severe and include destruction of seabed\ninfrastructure (e.g. telecommunications cables), subsidence of coastal areas and\ngeneration of damaging tsunamis. In this latter respect, ﬂank collapses on\noceanic islands, which consist largely of rock (rather than sediment) and have\nboth subaerial and submarine components, pose a particular threat. The aim of\nthis paper is to summarize key aspects of submarine landslides, especially where\nthese relate to their hazard potential, and assess our ability (or lack of ability) to\npredict where and when future submarine landslides will occur.\nLandslide terminology is beyond the remit of this paper, but as noted by\nseveral authors (Hampton et al. 1996; Mulder & Alexander 2001; Canals et al.\n2004) the reader should be aware of the complexity of landslide nomenclature\nand the frequent imprecise use of landslide terminology, especially in the\nsubmarine environment where information on landslide processes is often\nlimited. In this paper, ‘landslide’ is used as a generic term encompassing all\nforms of slope failure, irrespective of process.

In the North Atlantic, this\ncorresponds mainly to areas at high and low latitudes (Weaver et al. 2000)\nand appears to correlate with the weathering style of rocks on land. In general,\nglacial action at high latitudes and chemical weathering processes at low\nlatitudes produce ﬁne-grained sediments that form thick accumulations on the\ncontinental slope and appear to favour landslide formation. Between these zones,\nat mid-latitudes, ﬂuvial weathering and sediment transport produces greater\nquantities of coarser grained sediment. This sediment is often transported\ndirectly to the deep ocean basins by turbidity currents, which pass through\nsubmarine canyons and bypass the slope. Although small landslides frequently\noccur on canyon margins, adjacent slopes are relatively starved of sediment and\nappear less likely to be affected by landslides. The submarine deltas and fans of\nlarge rivers are also subject to widespread landsliding, related to the rapid\naccumulation of ﬁne-grained sediments on the continental slope (e.g. Mississippi",

In fjord\nenvironments, landslides are frequently associated with ‘quick clay’, a\nparticularly unstable sediment created when marine clays are uplifted above\nsea level (usually by glacial rebound) and leached by fresh water (Locat et al.\n2003). Failure of submarine deltas formed where rivers discharge sediment onto\nthe steep submarine walls of fjords is also common (Prior et al. 1982; Kulikov\net al. 1996). Landslides on ocean-island ﬂanks have been cited as posing a\ntsunami threat on a trans-oceanic scale (Ward & Day 2001), potentially\ncomparable in magnitude to or even larger than the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami\n(Lay et al. 2005). While this extreme scenario can be questioned (Mader 2001;\nWynn & Masson 2003), there is little doubt that the threat posed by ocean-island\nﬂank landslides is both real and signiﬁcant.",

        "text": "The largest submarine landslides can involve many thousand km3 of material,\ntwo to three orders of magnitude larger than any terrestrial landslide (table 1;\nHampton et al. 1996). For example, the Storegga slide involved some 3000 km3 of\nsediment, affected 95 000 km2 of the Norwegian slope and basin and had a run-\nout distance of around 800 km (Haﬂidason et al. 2004). To put this into\nperspective, the area is about 20% bigger than Scotland and the run-out is close\nto the length of mainland Britain.\nThe largest landslides occur mainly in two settings, on open continental\nmargins and on oceanic island ﬂanks. This appears to be a function of speciﬁc\naspects of the geology and morphology of these areas. Continental margin slopes\nthat are subject to large-scale failures are typically of low gradient (from less\nthan 18 to 58) with gentle topography; however, the ‘drop’ from shelf edge to\nbasin ﬂoor can be up to 5 km over distances of a few hundred kilometres.\nParallel-bedded sediment sequences with little variability over large areas\ncharacterize their sub-surface structure, with the result that, should the\nconditions for slope failure occur, they can simultaneously affect large areas.\nWhen measured from the top of the highest volcano to the bottom of the\nadjacent ocean basin, ocean islands such as Hawaii and the Canary islands have\nthe greatest relief of any topographic feature on Earth. The island slopes can be\nvery steep (e.g. on Tenerife in the Canary islands the average slope from the top\nof Teide volcano to the coast is 158) and volcanic processes tend to build, load\nand steepen these slopes with time. Despite this, not all these slopes are unstable,",

(b) Distribution of slope gradients\nbetween 36 and 378N and between 200 and 3000 m water depth on the eastern North American slope\n(extracted from multibeam data gridded at 100 m). Comparison of the histogram shapes in (a) and\n(b) suggests that landslide occurrence is largely independent of slope angle at gradients more than\n38, but that landslides are relatively rarer on lower slope gradients. A plot of landslide occurrence\nper unit area against slope gradient (c) gives some support to the qualitative comparison of (a) and\n(b) based on histogram shape, although the correlation in (c) is weakened by the scatter of data\npoints which is mainly due to the low numbers of observed landslides. (d ) Number of landslides\nplotted against water depth in the headwall region, indicating that most landslides are initiated in\nmid-slope. Similar distributions of landslides are seen in the eastern Atlantic conﬁrming the\nrobustness of the interpretations based on (a)–(d ) above (Hu¨hnerbach et al. 2004).",

        "text": "earthquake resulted in submarine landslides, a turbidity current, and a tsunami\nthat caused signiﬁcant casualties (Heezen & Ewing 1952; Piper et al. 1999; Fine\net al. 2005). This is one of the best-known submarine landslides because the\nresultant turbidity current broke several submarine cables sequentially down-\nslope, allowing the speed of such a current (up to 30 m sK1) to be measured for\nthe ﬁrst time. It also illustrates one of the main difﬁculties in submarine\ngeohazard study—when a coupled earthquake/landslide generates a tsunami,\nwhich of the two hazards produces the tsunami or could their effects even be\ncombined (Fryer et al. 2004; Fine et al. 2005)? The latter has been suggested for\nthe 1998 tsunami that struck Papua New Guinea (PNG), killing over 2000 people\n(Satake & Tanioka 2003). However, there is now considerable evidence that\nmany ‘unusual’ tsunamis, particularly those with high near-ﬁeld run-ups that\ndecay rapidly away from source, are directly caused by landslides (Bardet et al.\n2003; Okal & Synolakis 2004). Rotational slides (often referred to as slumps),\nwhere a thick slide block with a steep headwall can move rapidly downward, may\nbe particularly effective in generating tsunamis, even when the lateral distance\nmoved is small and little effect is seen on the seaﬂoor downslope of the immediate\nlandslide site. The PNG tsunami is most likely to have been generated in this\nway (Matsumoto & Tappin 2003; Sweet & Silver 2003).\nFinally, it should not be forgotten that an increasing proportion of the world’s\noil and gas is now recovered from deep-water areas offshore, where slope\ninstability can be a major geohazard. The juxtaposition of the Ormen Lange gas\nﬁeld, which is set to supply some 20% of UK natural gas requirements in future\nyears, and the Storegga slide, brings this sharply into focus.",

        "text": "Many factors have been suggested as probable or possible contributors to the\ninitiation of submarine landslides (table 2). These vary from sudden impacts\noperating on timescales of minutes (e.g. shaking due to earthquakes) to\ngeological processes operating on timescales of tens to hundreds of thousands\nof years (e.g. climate change; Weaver & Kuijpers 1983). Broadly, they can be\ndivided into two types, those related to the geological characteristics of the\nlandslide material (e.g. overpressure due to rapid deposition or the presence of a\nweak layer) and those driven by transient external events (e.g. earthquakes or\nclimate change). In some cases, the relationship between a landslide and its cause\nis very obvious and direct (e.g. failure of an oversteepened slope). In others this\nrelationship may not be obvious at all, especially where the link is indirect and\ninvolves some intermediate process. A good example of this is found on the\nNorwegian continental slope where the locations of landslides, such as the\nStoregga and Traenadjupet slides, can be related to the occurrence of speciﬁc\ngeological horizons that act as weak layers (Laberg et al. 2003; Kvalstad et al.\n2005). The distribution of these weak layers, however, is controlled by regional\nchanges in sedimentation style, which, on an even broader scale, are driven\nby climate change between glacial and interglacial conditions (Bryn et al. 2005).\nOn top of all of this, it has been calculated that an earthquake was still required\nto ultimately trigger these landslides (Bryn et al. 2005; Kvalstad et al. 2005)!",

        "text": "The above example shows that many if not all landslides result from the coming\ntogether of more than one of the factors given in table 2. Most continental slope\nsediments, for example, are stable under all but the most extreme earthquake\nshaking, unless other factors, such as overpressured layers or sensitive sediments\nare present (Roberts & Cramp 1996; Kvalstad et al. 2005). Many large historical\nlandslides, recognized because they broke telephone cables or caused collapse of\nriver deltas in fjords or tsunamis, have coincided with earthquakes (Tappin et al.\n2001; Fryer et al. 2004; Fine et al. 2005). This presumably reﬂects the long term\npersistence of ‘geological’ factors compared to the transient nature of earthquake\nshaking, such that the short-lived transient event is the ﬁnal push which tips the\nbalance between a stable slope and a landslide.\nHuman activities can also contribute to submarine landslide triggering.\nAlthough landslides generated in this way are usually small, they can often be\nvery dangerous because they extend upslope onto land and can affect inhabited\nareas. Examples include the 1996 Finneidfjord landslide, where it has been\nhypothesized that the trigger was heavy rainfall combined with rock blasting\n(Longva et al. 1996), and the 1979 Nice Airport landslide, where loading of the\nupper slope during construction work at the airport probably contributed\n(Assier-Rzadkiewicz et al. 2000). In other areas where submarine landslides have\ndirectly affected human-made structures, such as where buildings on deltas have\nbeen submerged or offshore oil installations destroyed by landslides, it is often\nimpossible to determine (and sometimes unlikely) that human activities\ntriggered the landslides. However, even if human activity is not to blame for\ntriggering such landslides, building in these areas has undoubtedly contributed to\nthe landslide consequences.\nThe concept that ‘weak layers’ oriented parallel to sedimentary bedding might\ncontrol the location of many continental slope landslides is not new (see O’Leary\n(1991) and references therein). However, it required the advent of modern\nseaﬂoor survey technology, such as swath bathymetric mapping and 3D seismic",

Indeed, it seems that\nsubmarine landslides at all scales are often controlled in this way (Lastras et al.\n2004; Wilson et al. 2004; Bryn et al. 2005). However, we know very little about\nthe nature and characteristics of these weak layers, since they have rarely been\nsampled and very little geotechnical work has been done on sediments recovered\nfrom them. The weak layers that underlie parts of the Storegga slide are a\nnotable exception (Bryn et al. 2005; Kvalstad et al. 2005). Here it has been shown\nthat the weak layers are composed of contourites (sediments deposited by ocean\ncurrents ﬂowing along the continental slope) that are clay-rich and have higher\nwater content and greater plasticity than the overlying less-well sorted glacial\nand glaciomarine sediments. As a result, the contourites are more sensitive and\nbrittle (i.e. they lose strength rapidly when their strain bearing capacity is\nexceeded). Rapid loading of the water-rich contourites by glacial sediments\nappears to have raised pore pressures within the contourites and is the main\nfactor contributing to landsliding.\nMany sedimented slopes prone to submarine landslides show a history of\nlandsliding that extends back through geological time. This observation can\noften be applied at quite local scales, with areas showing stacked landslide\ndeposits sharply demarcated from those showing long-term stability (Solheim\net al. 2005). The same is true of some volcanic island slopes, for example in the\nCanary islands, where part of the north ﬂank of Tenerife has experienced at",

In a regional sense, repeated landsliding will be a natural\nconsequence if the sediment deposition processes that generate the precondi-\ntions for landslides persist over long periods of time. Cyclic conditions, such as\nglacial/interglacial transitions may also contribute to repeated landsliding on\ntimescales similar to the cyclicity (Bryn et al. 2005). One of the key reasons for\nrepeated landslides at a site speciﬁc scale is that the scars created by landslides\noften act as traps for subsequent sedimentation, leading to enhanced\nsedimentation rates and increasing the risk of further landslides. Thus\ncontourites are preferentially deposited in landslide scars on the Norwegian\nmargin, enhancing weak layer development within these scars (Bryn et al. 2005;\nSolheim et al. 2005). Similarly, landslide scars in the Canary islands are\nfrequently the loci of subsequent volcanism, probably because the landslide\nremoves some of the overburden and creates an easier path for magma to reach",

Debris avalanches are less signiﬁcant in terms of total\ntransport, but they pose a particular threat to human populations.\nThere is a generally accepted ‘paradigm’ that landslides in cohesive sediments\nevolve downslope from slide to debris ﬂow to turbidity current through gradually\nincreasing disintegration and entrainment of water (e.g. Mulder & Cochonat\n1996; Ilstad et al. 2004; Bryn et al. 2005). However, this is probably an\noversimpliﬁcation in that some landslides travel many hundreds of km without\nappreciable transformation into turbidity currents, while others transform\nentirely into turbidity currents very close to source. In truth, the formation of\nlarge turbidity currents, in which a few hundred km3 of (usually cohesive)\nsediment are rapidly mixed with much larger volumes of seawater, is a very\npoorly understood process (Talling et al. 2002).\nLarge landslides in continental margin sedimentary sequences are often\ncomplex events, and elements of slide, debris ﬂow and turbidity current may all\nbe evident in the aftermath of a single landslide. Often the slide scar will contain\ndisplaced but coherent slide blocks made up of sediments that have travelled",

Further downslope, the landslide\ndeposit may show ﬂow structures characteristic of debris ﬂow processes (ﬁgure 5).\nA turbidity current initiated by the landslide may travel hundreds of km beyond\nthe obvious limit of the debris deposit, with no obvious connecting pathway or\ndeposit. In this situation the correlation between turbidite and landslide can\noften only be established on the basis of precise dating, sedimentology and/or\ngeochemical analysis (Pearce & Jarvis 1992; Wynn et al. 2002).\nTheoretical and experimental studies have shown that landslides on slopes as\nlow as 0.58 are only possible where excess pore pressures at the level of the\ndetachment surface support a large fraction of the weight of the landslide mass,\nthus decreasing the effective stress and the friction with the underlying substrate\n(Iverson 1997; Kvalstad et al. 2005). High pore pressures can be created through\nrapid sediment deposition (especially in ﬁne-grained sediments with low\npermeability), collapse of the sediment structure (so-called ‘sensitive clays’)\ndue to earthquake shaking, or possibly due to melting of gas hydrates contained\nwithin the sediment.\nDebris avalanches occur when a mass of cohesionless material, usually\nfragmented rock, moves downslope. In the subaerial realm, debris avalanches\ntypically occur on slopes that range from 258 to near vertical; in this situation\nthey can attain speeds as high as 100 m sK1 (360 km hK1; Voight & Pariseau\n1978). The most widely known debris avalanches in the submarine realm are\nthose that occur on the ﬂanks of volcanic islands (Moore et al. 1989; Watts &\nMasson 1995; Ollier et al. 1998; Masson et al. 2002), although they also occur in\nconsolidated sedimentary rocks on active continental margins due to failure of\nsteep slopes generated by tectonic processes (Hu¨hnerbach et al. 2005). On the\nsubmarine ﬂanks of volcanic islands such as the Canary islands, debris avalanche\nfailure planes dip oceanward at 108 or less, suggesting that these avalanches are\nless energetic than their subaerial counterparts. The blocky character of\nsubmarine debris avalanche deposits probably reﬂects the friable nature of the\nvolcanic material and the distance of transport (typically an order of magnitude\ngreater than the biggest subaerial avalanches) rather than the speed of the\nemplacement process. This is further discussed in §8.",

        "text": "An elegant geotechnical model for the Storegga slide was constructed by\nKvalstad et al. (2005) who demonstrated that the best explanation for the slide\nrequired a combination of one or more weak layers, identiﬁed as marine clays\n(contourites) deposited during interglacial periods, and excess pore pressures\ndeveloped as a result of the rapid sedimentation that loaded the Norwegian slope\nduring intervening glacial periods. Evidence that high pore pressures existed in\nthe area comes from measurements adjacent to the slide, where remnant high\npressures can still be found. Modelling of the pore pressures found that excess\npore pressure ratios of the order of 0.9 were required to cause failure. In simple\nterms this means that the strength of the sediment was reduced to about 10% of\nits normal level. There is clear evidence that instability only developed at certain\nlevels in the sediment and that consequently most of the sediment pile was\ninherently stable. This is best seen on high-resolution seismic data that show\nfaulted and fractured slide debris preserved within the slide scar (Kvalstad et al.\n2005). It is also shown by the long term stability of the steep slide headwall\nscarps, which have stood with angles of up to 358 for over 8000 years since the\nexcess pore pressure in the weak layers was released by the landslide.\nThe area of the Storegga slide shows a long-term history of sedimentation and\nlandsliding that reﬂects glacial/interglacial cyclicity (Solheim et al. 2005). This\nleads to the conclusion that the state of stability that has characterized the\nStoregga slide area since the last landslide occurred is unlikely to change until the\nnext interglacial/glacial cycle has been completed.",

The Nuuanu\nlandslide, off Oahu in the Hawaiian islands, with an estimated volume of\n5000 km3, may be the largest single landslide on earth (Moore et al. 1989).\nLandslides on volcanic islands typically take two forms—debris avalanches and\nslumps (in the terminology used in this paper a slump is a type of slide). As\ndeﬁned by Moore et al. (1989), a debris avalanche is a relatively thin (0.4–2 km\nthick) landslide with a clear evacuated headwall and a distal train of blocky\ndebris. Each debris avalanche appears to be a single event, at least in terms of\ngeological time, and some show evidence for rapid and energetic emplacement.\nIn contrast, a slump involves gradual, intermittent, downslope movement of a\nthick (up to 10 km) coherent block of the island ﬂank.\nThe history of landslides in the Canary islands over the past one million years\nis now well understood (see Masson et al. (2002) and references within). The bulk\nof landslide activity is associated with the youngest and most volcanically active\nislands of Tenerife, La Palma and El Hierro (ﬁgure 6). On average, one landslide\nhas occurred somewhere in the Canary islands every 100 000 years, although this\nﬁgure masks an irregular distribution through time (Masson et al. 2002). The\nyoungest landslide occurred on the island of El Hierro some 15 000 years ago.\nMost of the landslides are debris avalanches, with slumps only recognized on the\nyoungest island, El Hierro, perhaps suggesting that this landslide style is a\nfeature of early island development.

This typical avalanche has a volume of 50–200 km3, covers\nan area of a few thousand km2 and has a run-out of 50–100 km. Glide planes at\nthe base of the landslide are typically up to 108 on the upper slope, decreasing to\nless than 58 on the lower slope (Watts & Masson 1995; Gee et al. 2001; Watts &\nMasson 2001). Large accumulations of debris, such as seen north of Tenerife or\nwest of La Palma, are clearly the cumulative result of several landslides rather\nthan single larger events that have occurred in the past. Even some deposits\nthought to be the result of a ‘single’ landslide event (in geological time) show\nsigns of more than one phase of emplacement (Watts & Masson 2001). It is\nnotable that Canary island debris avalanches are an order of magnitude smaller\nthan those on Hawaii, possibly reﬂecting the larger size and higher magma\nproduction rates of the Hawaiian islands or the more rapid development of\ninstability on the relatively steeper Canary island slopes.\nCanary island landslides identiﬁed as debris avalanches according to the\ndeﬁnition of Moore et al. (1989) show a variety of structures that suggest\nelements of both debris avalanche and debris ﬂow emplacement mechanisms",

In addition, these landslides can also initiate\nturbidity currents that are capable of ﬂowing considerable distances downslope.\nSediment cores recovered from the deep Agadir Basin, about 300 km to the north\nof the islands, contain turbidite deposits which, based upon their mineralogy,\ngeochemistry and age, are interpreted to be linked to Canary island landslides\n(Wynn et al. 2002; Wynn & Masson 2003). Speciﬁcally, a turbidite deposited\nat w15 kyr is linked to the El Golfo landslide on El Hierro, while an older\nturbidite dated at ca 170 kyr is linked to the Icod landslide on Tenerife. Most\nturbidite deposits in the Agadir Basin are actually derived from the Moroccan\ncontinental margin to the east (Wynn et al. 2002), and show the typical smooth\nupward-ﬁning grain-size proﬁle that is typical of graded turbidite deposits\n(ﬁgure 9). However, the two turbidites derived from Canary islands landslides\nshow a stepped grain-size proﬁle that appears to represent deposition from a\nseries of ‘mini-turbidites’ (ﬁgure 9). This pattern is interpreted to be the result of\na multi-stage source landslide, as other potential causes, e.g. ﬂow reﬂection,\nmultiple pathways or pulses, can be ruled out (Wynn & Masson 2003). This\nhypothesis is also supported by the fact that similar turbidites linked to\nHawaiian landslides show the same pattern of stacked mini-turbidites (Garcia\n1996). Detailed sedimentological analysis of the Agadir Basin turbidites has\nrevealed that their source landslides probably occurred in several retrogressive\nstages over a period of hours or days rather than weeks or months (Wynn &\nMasson 2003). Assessing the sedimentary record of deposits derived from these\nlandslides is therefore critical when assessing their tsunamigenic potential, since\nit is clear that a series of smaller landslides spread over several hours will have a\nmuch smaller tsunami-building potential than a single large, instantaneous\nlandslide (see §8).",

However, the complexity and variability of submarine\nlandslides means that we are still some way from a comprehensive understanding\nof the range of tsunamis that landslides are capable of producing. Modelling of\nlandslide tsunamis has shown both that extreme wave heights of hundreds of\nmetres might be possible (Ward & Day 2001; McMurty et al. 2004), but that\nmodels are sensitive to the geological input parameters and the hydrody-\nnamic assumptions adopted in the model (Ward 2001; Haugen et al. 2005;\nLovholt et al. 2005), with the result that poorly constrained model predictions\nwill have large uncertainty.\nDespite the variability of submarine landslides that might cause tsunamis,\nmany such tsunamis show similar general characteristics.

This is a consequence of the relatively\nsmall source areas of most landslide tsunami (compared to the areas affected by\nlarge earthquakes) that leads to the generation of shorter wavelength waves.\nThese are more prone to coastal ampliﬁcation (increasing the local effect) and to\nradial damping (decreasing the distal effect). This contrasts with the lack of\nradial damping seen in earthquake tsunamis that are generated by elongate two-\ndimension sources; these tsunamis propagate perpendicular to the source fault\nwith little radial spreading.\nThe tsunami generated some 8200 years ago by the Storegga slide off Norway\nis one of the best-understood landslide tsunamis. A well-preserved record of\ntsunami deposits on land in Norway, Scotland and the Faroe islands (Dawson\net al. 1988; Bondevik et al. 1997, 2005) coupled with an unprecedented knowledge\nof the landslide processes (Bryn et al. 2003, 2005; Haﬂidason et al. 2003, 2004;\nKvalstad et al. 2005), provides the basis for rigorous testing of tsunami models\nand allows the key landslide parameters to be identiﬁed (Bondevik et al. 2005;\nHaugen et al. 2005; Lovholt et al. 2005). The key ﬁndings are that landslide\nvolume, velocity, initial acceleration, length and thickness all contribute to the\ndetermination of tsunami character. The best indicator of tsunamigenic potential\nis the product of volume and initial acceleration (Lovholt et al. 2005). An abrupt\ndeceleration might also contribute to larger surface elevations. The slide length\naffects both the wavelength and the maximum surface elevation (Haugen et al.\n2005), while the wavelength is also determined by the travel time or run-out\ndistance of the slide. Submarine slides are normally clearly subcritical, i.e. the\nFroude number (the ratio of slide speed to the speed of wave propagation) is\nmuch less than one. This implies that the tsunami will run away from the wave-\ngenerating slide, limiting the build-up of the wave. Slides in shallow waters are\nmore critical, since the speed of wave propagation is lower here. Moreover,\nshallower water normally means less distance to the coast and a shorter distance\navailable for radial damping. In contrast, tsunamis generated by earthquakes are\nmore critical when the seabed displacement occurs in deeper waters, as the initial\nwave (which in this case depends much less on the water depth) will become\nshorter and more dangerously ampliﬁed when propagating from deeper to\nshallower waters.\nThe Storegga slide is best modelled as a retrogressive slide, with a peak velocity\nof 25–30 m sK1 (Bondevik et al. 2005). The retrogressive slide, of total length L, is\nmodelled as a train of N ﬁxed block slides released at different times t, but moving\nwith identical velocity distributions (Haugen et al. 2005). For simplicity, the\nblocks have the same thickness h and the same length L/N. Moreover, the time lag\nDt between release of two adjacent blocks is assumed to be equal. For waves\npropagating in the same direction as the slide, increasing Dt increases the distance\nbetween the surface elevations caused by the individual block modules. This\ndecreases the overlap and results in a smaller amplitude and longer wave\n(ﬁgure 10). For small time lags, the wave remains smooth, but as Dt increases, the\ndistances between the individual block modules become large and the discrete\nnature of the retrogressive slide starts to show. Eventually, when Dt is sufﬁciently\nlarge, the waves generated by the block modules are completely separated.",

As the time lags are increased\nfurther, the waves moving in the opposite direction of the block modules exhibit\nthe same dependence on Dt as described above for the wave moving in the same\ndirection as the slide.\nModels of the Storegga slide indicate that retrogression must have been rapid,\ntaking less than one hour; slower retrogression cannot reproduce the observed\ntsunami run-up pattern. Bondevik et al. (2005) compared ﬁeld observations with\nrun-up heights deduced from new numerical simulations of the Storegga slide\ntsunami (ﬁgure 11). The shape and volume of the slide were adjusted to new and\nmore detailed reconstructions of the slide (Forsberg 2002; Haﬂidason et al. 2005).\nIn the revised slide model the maximum thickness (400 m) of the slide is near the\nupper headwall and it becomes gradually thinner towards the slide front in the\noffshore direction. The slide is modelled as a box that is skewed and smoothed to\nreproduce the reconstructed morphology of the Storegga slide, and moves with\nmaximum velocities of 20–35 m sK1. All simulations use a run-out distance of\n150 km. A linear, long wave numerical model simulates the tsunami. A maximum\nvelocity between 25 and 30 m sK1 with a 25% reduction of the surface elevation\ndue to landslide retrogression makes the best match to the ﬁeld observations\n(Bondevik et al. 2005). According to a two-dimension retrogressive slide model\n(Haugen et al. 2005), such a reduction is obtained with a very little time lag,\nabout 15–20 s between the sliding blocks. Velocities of 25–30 m sK1 are also\nsupported by De Blasio et al. (2005), who ﬁnd mean (centre of mass) slide\nvelocities of 25–35 m sK1 in their run-out studies of the Storegga slide.",

        "text": "conclusions have been reached by other authors (e.g. Mader 2001) who provide\nestimates of wave elevation along the North American coast an order of\nmagnitude smaller than those calculated by Ward & Day (2001).\nAs noted for the Storegga slide, tsunami wave elevation is strongly inﬂuenced\nby landslide volume (or by some combination of landslide frontal area, length\nand thickness), by peak velocity, and by initial acceleration. For the La Palma\nscenario Ward & Day (2001) used maximum possible values for these\nparameters, adopting a ‘worst-case’ geological scenario as their model input.\nHowever, geological understanding of Canary island landslides, especially the\noffshore deposits, provides a number of reasons for challenging the models of\nWard & Day (2001). These include questions of landslide process, volume and\nvelocity. In terms of landslide failure processes, the scars left on the islands give\nfew clues. However, they do allow the slopes of the glide planes on which the\nslides occurred to be measured. Even the steepest of these, on the upper slope of\nthe El Golfo landslide off the island of El Hierro, only reaches a maximum of 108,\ndecreasing to about 58 at the base of the island ﬂank where the avalanche deposit\nbegins (Gee et al. 2001). Further offshore, key features of the landslide deposits\nsuggest that both debris avalanche and debris ﬂow processes are involved in\nlandslide emplacement (ﬁgure 9). The question of what this debris avalanche\nmorphology actually tells us about the emplacement process, and particularly\nabout the velocity of the landslide, is clearly important. Unfortunately, the term\ndebris avalanche immediately brings to mind the rapid, catastrophic rock\navalanches that occur in mountain ranges on land (Voight & Pariseau 1978).\nThese can reach velocities in the order of 100 m s–1 on slopes that range from 258\nto near vertical (Plafker & Ericksen 1978; Voight & Pariseau 1978). However, it\nis difﬁcult to envisage this type of process for Canary island debris avalanches,\nwhere the slide plane gradients are less than 108. Here it seems likely that the\ndebris avalanche morphology reﬂects the disintegration of a slide composed of\nbrittle volcanic rock and therefore primarily reﬂects the non-cohesive character\nof the slide material. In this situation, it probably tells us little about the velocity\nof the landslide.\nNevertheless, general considerations of submarine landslide behaviour leads\nus to predict that Canary island landslides must be relatively energetic, so\npeak velocities in the order of 50 m sK1 need to be considered in tsunami\nmodelling. This is supported by evidence from the Ritter island volcano\ncollapse, where velocities of 40 m sK1 have been modelled on the basis of\nknown landslide volume and tsunami run-up heights (Ward & Day 2003) and\nfrom offshore Hawaii, where debris avalanches that run-up the far side of the\nislands’ ﬂexural moat require velocities in the order of 80 m sK1. Using the\nscaling arguments of Ward & Day (2003), Canary island landslides might be\nexpected to have velocities intermediate between those of the above examples,\nalthough given that the glide plane for the Ritter island landslide (10–258) is\nconsiderably steeper than glide planes in the Canaries (5–108), 50 m sK1 might\nbe considered a maximum for Canaries examples. This is still well below the\nvelocity at which the tsunami would propagate in the deep water west of the\nCanary islands, so little coupling between the landslide and the tsunami would\noccur. The initial acceleration of the landslide is even less well constrained\nthan the peak velocity, but is just as critical in determining the tsunami-\ngenerating potential of a landslide (Haugen et al. 2005).

Ward & Day (2001) used a volume of 500 km3 in\ntheir calculations with the assumption that this failed as a single block. However,\nthis volume is two to three times bigger than a typical Canary island landslide,\neven though the area affected by their potential landslide is quite typical. This is\nbecause they assume a failure surface ‘2–3 km below the summit of the volcano’\n(Ward & Day 2001), despite the fact that reconstruction of other landslides on the\nCanary islands, supported by the offshore debris ﬂow volumes, show their\nmaximum thicknesses to be in the order of 1–1.5 km (Urgeles et al. 1997; Masson\net al. 2002; Hurlimann et al. 2004). Most importantly, observations of turbidites\nassociated with Canary island (and Hawaiian) landslides show that they did not\nfail as single blocks, and that the separation in time of the phases of the multi-stage\nfailures was almost certainly sufﬁcient to separate their tsunami-building\npotential (see §7).\nIn summary, we would suggest that many of the parameters used in the worst-\ncase scenario for a future landslide from the island of La Palma, as modelled by\nWard & Day (2001), have been pushed to, or often beyond, their feasible\nmaximum values. Any future tsunami is thus likely to be smaller than the Ward\nand Day prediction. Furthermore, it needs to be recognized that the worst-case\nlandslide is in any case an unlikely event, with a probability much smaller than\nthe 1 in every 100 000 years re-occurrence time calculated overall for Canary\nisland landslides. Nevertheless, we can be certain that future landslides will occur\nin the Canaries. It is also probable that such an event will generate locally\ndevastating tsunamis, with run-ups exceeding anything seen in historical\ntsunamis elsewhere. However, the ability of such landslides to produce signiﬁcant\ntrans-oceanic tsunamis is much more questionable.",

An example is the\nfrequently used Bingham ﬂuid model, describing a viscous Newtonian ﬂuid\ncombined with a yield stress. Such a ﬂuid moves as a dense plug ﬂow riding on\ntop of a shear ﬂow. Material properties, including clay rheology, are of great\nimportance to the ﬂow dynamics and travel distance for the majority of events.\nThe material properties also affect the rate of erosion and channelization. In the\ndense layer, energy dissipation is due to particle–particle interaction in granular\nﬂows with high particle concentrations, and to viscosity for more ﬂuidized ﬂows\nwith lower particle concentration. Clay slurries exhibit yield strength threshold\nbehaviour and viscosity, not only for (visco-plastic) shear ﬂows, but also in\nextensional ﬂows.\nIn modelling of failure and rupture, the separation of two material volumes\nthat were originally adjacent poses speciﬁc problems. In simulating the evolution\nof a sliding block at the escarpment during the retrogressive phase of the\nStoregga slide, the progressive decay of the original slab into wedge-shaped\nblocks had to be reproduced (ﬁgure 12). Two key factors in the model were\nresponsible for the emergence of shear bands at the correct places (i.e. as\nobserved in high-resolution proﬁles across the landslide), namely the assumption\nof shear softening and the high-resolution grid. All time- and location-dependent\nmaterial properties such as the yield strength had to be advected with the ﬂow,\nrequiring substantial computing resources.\nFor engineering purposes, knowledge of impact loads is needed for both granular,\nvisco-plastic and suspension ﬂows. Depth-averaged (hydraulic) models may\nsimulate high-Froude number granular ﬂows against obstacles quite well (applying\nappropriate shock-capturing numerical schemes). For suspension ﬂows with\nFroude numbers close to 1, the assumption of hydrostatic pressure distribution in\nthe hydraulic models is poor in the head of the current where the largest pressures\nhave to be expected, and complex two-dimension or three-dimension models may\nhave to be used. The situation is less clear for visco-plastic ﬂows because the\nrheology is only partially known, and because determination of yield surfaces will be\ninvolved. Today, it is not known whether two-dimension (depth-averaged) models\nare applicable when the yield strength is important.",

As a rule\nthis simple practice does sufﬁce.\nFor submarine slides the corresponding simple source model is an equivalent\nsink/source distribution with prescribed shape and motion. However, this is\nindeed a crude model for submarine slides, for which the interaction between the\nsolid constituents of the ﬂow and the ﬂuid may be crucial both for the slide\ndynamics and the generation of the tsunami. For rock-type slides depth\nintegrated wave equations may still be used in combination with corresponding\nslide models, maybe with parameterization of features like exchange of ﬂuid\nbetween the slide body and the surrounding ﬂuid. On the other hand, mud type\nmass gravity ﬂows will entrain water, and produce turbulence and large vortices,\nwhile form drag may have a crucial inﬂuence on the shape and dynamics of the\nmudﬂow. For slides with a subaerial origin the impact in water and progression\nin shallow depths involve wave breaking and huge wave resistance (momentum\nexchange with surface gravity waves in the water). Another challenge is the\nretrogressive slide dynamics (see §8), where the tsunami generation by a series of\nsmaller slide masses clearly calls for hydrodynamic analysis and modelling\nbeyond long wave assumptions. In short, a proper quantitative description of\nmass gravity ﬂows and their tsunami generation requires general hydrodynamic\ncomputational tools, like Navier–Stokes type models, but with modiﬁed rheology\nfor the denser types of slide masses. Today, three-dimension models of this kind\nare so computationally demanding that simulations with sufﬁcient resolution are\ndifﬁcult to perform even on the most powerful computers.\nAssuming that an appropriate model is available for the mass gravity ﬂow and\nthe generation of surface waves, the far-ﬁeld tsunami propagation still has to be\nhandled with some set of depth integrated, long wave equations, that must be\ncoupled with the more complex model for the source region. In many cases the\nvicinity of the slide will be dominated by ﬂow structures associated with vortices\nand turbulence that cannot be conveyed properly to a depth integrated model.\nIn comparison to the energy and momentum following the tsunami, these\nfeatures are advected much more slowly by the material ﬂuid velocity. Hence, the\nsimplest option would be to employ a large source region that allows the\ntransition of pure waves to the depth integrated far ﬁeld. However, this will be",

        "text": "Landslides are ubiquitous features of submarine slopes in all geological settings\nand at all water depths. Because of their unique geological settings, submarine\nlandslides can be up to two orders of magnitude bigger than those that occur on\nland. Hazards related to such landslides, ranging from destruction of offshore\nfacilities to collapse of coastal facilities and the generation of tsunamis, therefore\noccur widely.\nMost submarine slopes are inherently stable and require external, often\ntransient effects to trigger landslides. Elevated pore pressures, related to processes\nsuch as earthquake shaking or rapid sedimentation appear to be the critical factor\nin most submarine landslides. Such pore pressures support part or all of the weight\nof the overlying sediment, thus lowering the frictional resistance to landsliding.\nWhen concentrated in speciﬁc geological layers, they create weak layers, which fail\nin a characteristic bedding plane parallel style. The Storegga slide, off western\nNorway, is a classic example of this type of landslide showing several distinct gently\nsloping failure planes parallel to the sedimentary bedding, steep headwall scarps\nseparating the different glide plane levels, retrogressive landslide behaviour, and\nclear evidence that most of the landslide mass deformed by brittle deformation.\nLandslides on the ﬂanks of oceanic volcanic islands, such as the Canary islands,\nhave received much attention because of their potential tsunamigenic behaviour.\nWhile it is certain that such landslides have occurred in the past and will again\noccur in the future, the causes and triggers of ﬂank failure are relatively poorly\nunderstood. The best evidence suggests that these landslides are retrogressive and\noccur over a period of hours or days, rather than the instantaneous failure of a\nsingle coherent block. It therefore seems unlikely that simple models that treat\nthese landslides as single rapidly moving blocks can accurately predict their\ntsunamigenic potential. In any case, it needs to be remembered that any worst-\ncase scenario model, such as that produced by Ward & Day (2001) for La Palma in\nthe Canary islands, which maximizes every model parameter, has a low probability\nof occurrence in the real world.",
