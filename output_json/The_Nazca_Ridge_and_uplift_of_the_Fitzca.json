During the Miocene, the Fitzcarrald Arch did not \nexist and this area corresponded to the subsiding foredeep of the Amazonian foreland basin. Analyses of the \nMiocene deposits outcropping within the Fitzcarrald Arch area indicate that deposition was controlled by \ntidal current and consisted of tide-dominated deltas and estuaries. The tidal Miocene deposits were followed \nby ﬂ uvial conglomerate and sandstone sediments, probably Pliocene to Pleistocene in age. Modelling of the \nvitrinite reﬂ ectance data shows that the uplift of the Fitzcarrald Arch began in Pliocene times; this date is \nfurther conﬁ rmed by sedimentary evidence such as provenance and a change of palaeocurrent directions from \nthe Pliocene and Pleistocene record. Geophysical data show that the Fitzcarrald Arch uplift superimposed on \nthe eastern part of the Nazca Ridge ﬂ at slab segment. The ﬂ at subduction process linked to the buoyancy of the \nNazca Ridge has been active since ~4 Ma. Thus, the coincidence of the initiation of ﬂ at slab subduction with \nthe Pliocene uplift of the Fitzcarrald Arch implies that the ﬂ at subduction of the Nazca Ridge is the cause of \nuplift. The Nazca Ridge ﬂ at subduction is the process responsible for the modern conﬁ guration of the Amazon \ndrainage basin and may be one of the decisive factors that triggered large-scale modiﬁ cation of the Amazonian \nlandscape inducing drastic biota changes in the Amazonian basin during the last 4 million years.",

        "text": "The structural and morphological Fitzcarrald Arch includes a \nlarge part of the western Amazon drainage basin (see Fig. 6.1). The \nFitzcarrald Arch forms a WSW–ENE-trending upland in south-\neastern Peru and western Brazil that covers about 400 000 km2, \ni.e. ~15% of the total surface of the Amazon ﬂ oodplain (Guyot \net al. 2007). The Fitzcarrald Arch develops east of the sub- Andean \nthrust front and south of the Contaya-Moa thrusts, where no \nthrust deformation occurs (Fig. 6.2a). It develops between the \nnorthwestern Ucayali sub-basin to the northeast, and Madre de \nDios sub-basin to the southeast, and is bounded to the northeast by \nthe Acre sub-basin (Kronberg et al. 1998; see also Chapter 3). The \nFitzcarrald Arch displays a higher mean elevation surface (~615 m \nasl [above sea level]) compared to its bounding Ucayali and Madre \nde Dios sub-basins (~120 m asl and ~150 m asl, respectively).\nThe Fitzcarrald Arch forms a main drainage divide (Church \n1901; Dumont 1996; Espurt et al. 2007; Regard et al. 2009) between \nthe Ucayali sub-basin, the Acre sub-basin and the Madre de Dios \nsub-basin. The drainage network has been digitized from Shuttle \nRadar Topographic Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model \n90 m using the TAS freeware (Terrain Analysis System; Lindsay \n2005). Seventy-one sub-basins of seventh order, representing an \naverage area of ~3660 km2, have been deﬁ ned on the Fitzcarrald \nArch (see Fig. 6.2a) according to Strahler’s method (1952) (see \nRegard et al. 2009 for more details). The mean orientation and \nelongation of each sub-basin have been measured. At a large scale, \nthe Fitzcarrald Arch disturbs the present-day drainage network of \nthe Amazon basin in generating an asymmetrical radial drainage. \nThe main part of the drainage network displays a northeasterly \ndirection (average value of N52°E; see Fig. 6.2b), toward the Acre \nsub-basin. The Fitzcarrald Arch divides the drainage basin of\nthe Ucayali to the northwest, and that of the Madre de Dios to the \nsoutheast. The apex of the drainage divide is located east of the \nsub-Andean thrust front, at roughly 10.5°S, 72.5°W (see Fig. 6.2a). \nMost of the basins located west of the apex exhibit drainage direc-\ntions towards the Andes (see Fig. 6.2a,b). At a local scale, seventh-\norder sub-basins develop on tilted Miocene and Pliocene surface \nbedding (Espurt et al. 2007; Regard et al. 2009). These sub-basins \nhave elongated surfaces and are poorly organized with parallel \nand subparallel patterns (see Fig. 6.2a).",

Dip of the bedding has been measured along \nregional topographic cross-sections from the SRTM digital eleva-\ntion model (see Fig. 6.2a). The eastern Brazilian ﬂ ank of the arch \nshows low-magnitude bedding dipping ~0.02° to the ENE. On the \nnorthwestern Ucayali ﬂ ank of the Arch, bedding dips ~0.3° north-\nwestwards. The most prominent tilted bedding surface is found \nnear the Ucayali River. This surface connects down with the Ucayali \nRiver and tops thick Pliocene conglomerate deposits (Dumont et al. \n1991; Räsänen et al. 1995). The surface tilting seems to postdate the \ndrainage over the surface of several tributaries of the Ucayali River \n(Dumont et al. 1991). The northern ﬂ ank of the Fitzcarrald Arch is \ngreatly incised and exhibits mainly Miocene strata. In contrast, the \nsoutheastern Madre de Dios ﬂ ank of the arch presents more gently \ntilted bedding dipping ~0.1° to the southeast (see Fig. 6.2a).\nThe NW–SE-trending regional seismic reﬂ ection proﬁ le provided \nby PeruPetro S.A.

The conglom-\nerates contain sandstone and mudstone clasts, less than 5 cm in \ndiameter, wood fragments and high concentrations of vertebrate \nfossils and teeth (Antoine et al. 2007; Salas-Gismondi et al. 2007), \nincorporated in a sandy matrix. The overlying interval is ~1.8 m \nthick and consists of alternating mud and sand layers exhibiting \nmud-sand couplets interpreted as tidal bundles (see Fig. 6.4c). \nMud drapes and double mud drapes as well as cyclic variations \nof the bundles are frequent and characterize tide-controlled \ndeposition (Nio & Yang 1991). In the lower part of this interval, \nthe sands exhibit mud-sand couplets with opposite bidirectional\nstratiﬁ cations (‘herring-bone’ cross-stratiﬁ cations) and ﬂ aser to \nlenticular bedding. Reactivation surfaces as well as mud drapes \nand double mud drapes are common. The palaeocurrent direc-\ntions are dominantly towards the northeast and southwest \n(see Fig. 6.4c). These deposits are commonly bioturbated. In \nthe upper part of this interval, type 2 climbing ripples (Jopling \n& Walker 1986) with sigmoid stratiﬁ cation (Mutti et al. 1985) \nunderlain by mud clasts are frequent and indicate tide-controlled\ndeposition (Nio & Yang 1991). The sedimentary succession \nends with mud and sand tidal rhythmites followed by palaeosol \ndeposits in the top (see Fig. 6.4a).\nThe diverse vertebrate Mapuya fauna (~30 taxa; Antoine et al.\n2007; Salas-Gismondi et al. 2007) is strongly reminiscent of Late \nMiddle Miocene Laventan faunas from Colombia, Venezuela and \nBrazil (13.5–11.8 Ma; Madden et al. 1997). In addition, a change \nin palaeomagnetic polarity data from normal to reverse provides \na numerical age around 13 Ma, owing to Laventan biochronol-\nogy and Global Magnetic Polarity Time Scale (GMPTS) (Madden \net al. 1997; Antoine et al. 2007).\nOn the eastern ﬂ ank of the Fitzcarrald Arch, the outcrops of the \nSolimões Formation have been described by Räsänen et al. (1995) \nand Hovikoski et al. (2008) along the Jurua and Acre Rivers and the \nPurus River (8.80610°S, 68.80330°W) (see Fig. 6.3). These Miocene \nsediments commonly consist of various types of tidally inﬂ uenced \ninclined heterolithic stratiﬁ cation (IHS)-bearing channel deposits \nthat are intercalated with pedogenically altered horizons (Hovikoski \net al. 2008). The palaeocurrents are variable between localities but \nare mainly toward the southeast and northeast (Räsänen et al.\n1995; Hovikoski et al. 2007). The vertebrate faunal assemblage of \nthe Neogene deposits of the Acre region indicates a Late Miocene \nage (Cozzuol 2006). The precise age of these deposits is estimated \nat 9.01 ± 0.28 Ma on the basis of argon-40/argon-39 (40Ar/39Ar) \ndating (mica and feldspar) of river level (Campbell et al. 2001; see \nFig. 6.3) along the Purus River (10.41530 °S, 71.172799°W).\nThe southern ﬂ ank of the Fitzcarrald Arch displays Late Miocene \ndeposits (Madre de Dios Formation) described by Roddaz \n(2004), Roddaz et al. (2004) and Hovikoski et al. (2005) along \nthe Manú (11.90318°S, 71.39417°S), Madre de Dios (12.56787°S, \n70.10265°W) and Inambari Rivers (12.92209°S, 70.34911°W) \n(see Fig. 6.3). The sedimentary series displays a 10–40 m thick-\nness of several sharp based successions. The individual tidal point \nbars are ~3 m thick and consist of tide-dominated estuarine and \ndelta deposits (Roddaz 2004; Roddaz et al. 2004; Hovikoski et al.\n2005).

They are ~40 to 50 m thick and con-\nsist of unconsolidated conglomerates displaying well-rounded \nquartzite and volcanic pebbles and wood remains, included in a \nsandy matrix (see Fig. 6.4a,d). The pebbles are less than 15 cm \nin diameter and their volcanic and quartzite compositions indi-\ncate an Andean provenance. This unconsolidated conglomerate \nis topped by a tuffaceous level not yet dated, sandy deposits and \npalaeosol muddy deposits. Palaeocurrent data from imbricate \ngravels indicate a ﬂ ow direction towards N355.\nOn the southern ﬂ ank of the arch, the Pliocene deposits consist of \nchannel-shaped conglomerates (lithofacies Gt, sensu Miall 1996) with \nquartzite, volcanic and white sandstone pebbles and planar cross-\nbedded sandstones (lithofacies Sp, sensu Miall 1996). The pebbles are \nfrom 1 to 5 cm in diameter. Conglomerates and sands are associated \nwith red massive muds and silts and are locally bioturbated (Roddaz \n2004). Along the Piedras River (12.05330°S, 69.90170°W), these \nPliocene deposits are dated at 3.12 ± 0.02 Ma (40Ar/39Ar dating on \nmicas from a tuffaceous level; Campbell et al. 2001; see Fig. 6.3).\nLike the Miocene sediments, the Pliocene deposits form a set \nof successive tilted and dissected morphostructural surfaces, like \nthose evidenced by the digital elevation model of the Ucayali and \nMadre de Dios sub-basins (see Fig. 6.2a; Espurt et al. 2007). Field \nobservations and image interpretation also indicate the uncon-\nformable disposition of the Pliocene on Miocene strata, particu-\nlarly in the northern ﬂ ank of the arch (see Figs 6.3 & 6.4a). On \nthe northern ﬂ ank of the arch, the age of the contact is not well \nconstrained. However, the Pliocene age of these series is related \nto overlying Pleistocene terrace deposits made up of weathered \nconglomerates (Dumont et al. 1991). On the southern ﬂ ank of the \narch, the age of the contact between Miocene and Pliocene strata \nis much better and is bracketed between ~9 and ~3 Ma.\nThe Pliocene deposits record a change in the geodynamic con-\ntext of the Amazon drainage basin from a ﬁ lled foreland basin",

The pebbles are included in a sandy \nand silty matrix (see Fig. 6.4a,e). The pebble imbrications indicate \na main palaeocurrent direction of N250°. This direction is par-\nallel to the present-day drainage direction of the Chicosillo River, \nwhich runs towards the west, i.e. towards the Andes. Dumont \net al. (1991) mentioned a radiocarbon age of 8520 ± 440 years \n(10.59364°S, 73.91033°W and 10.73521°S, 73.60313°W) for \nstepped ﬂ oodplain Pleistocene terraces along the Urubamba and \nUcayali Rivers (see Fig. 6.3). Along the Mapuya River (10.42422°S, \n73.05185°W), aggradational terraces located at about 50 m above \nthe water level consist of ﬁ ne sediments, quartzitic pebbles, carbon \ndebris and palaeosol deposits (see Fig. 6.3).\nOn the eastern ﬂ ank of the arch, Kronberg et al. (1998) \ndescribed Late Pleistocene(?) sediments that consist of lacustrine \nclays interlayered with thin carbonate beds rich in gypsum levels \nand vertebrate fossils (see Fig. 6.3). These sediments are inter-\npreted to be deposited in a ﬂ uvial-lacustrine environment with \nvariable hydrological conditions (Kronberg et al. 1998).\nThese ﬂ uvial deposits suggest a depositional system similar to \nthe present-day depositional system developed in the Fitzcarrald \nArch area. These deposits are strongly controlled by recent vertical \nmotions that are due to the uplift of the Fitzcarrald Arch.",

The dis-\ntance between these two wells is ~439 km. We also used add-\nitional data from the Sepa well (see Fig. 6.3) located ~60 km south \nof the Manshansha well. These data have been projected to the \nMashansha well along the same stratigraphic levels.\nThe interpretation of the well diagraphies (see Fig. 6.5a) com-\npleted with ﬁ eld data permit recognition of the different Cenozoic \nformations. The southern Puerto Primo well shows a 1.7 km-thick \nCenozoic pile that consists of, in ascending order: a 475 m thick-\nness of the Paleocene Huayabamba Formation; a 807 m thick-\nness of the Miocene Ipururo Formation; and 405 m thickness \nof the Miocene-Pliocene Madre de Dios Formation. In contrast, \nthe Mashansha well only displays a 1 km-thick Cenozoic pile, \nwhich consists of: 35 m thickness of the Paleocene Yahuarango \nFormation; 67 m thickness of the Eocene-Early Oligocene Pozo \nFormation; 410 m thickness of the Late Oligocene-Miocene \nChambira Formation; 474 m thickness of the Miocene Ipururo \nFormation, and ﬁ nally a 42 m thickness of Pleistocene alluvial \ndeposits. When compared with the Puerto Primo well succession, \nthe Late Miocene sediments of the Mashansha well are missing \nand have been eroded.\nRo data have been used to identify the unconformities and es-\ntimate the amount of denudation according to the geothermal \ngradient (Allen & Allen 2005). Ro data come from wood in late \nMiddle Miocene outcrops near the Mashansha well (Mapuya \nRiver) and from Paleozoic strata of the Mashansha well coupled \nwith additional Ro data of the Sepa well (see Fig. 6.5b) (Espurt \n2007). Thermal modelling of the Ro data shows a modelled \ncurve with three jumps (see Fig. 6.5b), which can be correlated \nwith three main unconformities and large stratigraphic gaps. The \nlower jump is correlated with the unconformity developed at the \nbase of the Late Carboniferous series (see Espurt et al. 2008). The \nintermediate jump is correlated with the unconformity developed \nat the base of the Cretaceous series (see Jaimes & de Freitas 2006 \nand references therein; see also Fig. 6.2c). Finally, the upper jump \nis correlated with the unconformity developed at the base of the \nPliocene continental series (see Figs 6.3 & 6.4). The model shows \nthat ~700 m thickness of Miocene series have been removed below \nthe Pliocene unconformity.\nThermal data allow us to constrain the Cenozoic basin mod-\nelling of the Fitzcarrald Arch area (see Fig. 6.5b). During the \nPaleocene-Oligocene period, the Amazonian foreland basins was \noccupied by ﬂ oodplain deposits (Wesselingh & Salo 2006). The \nsedimentation rates are about 10–25 m/million years and the sub-\nsidence rates are low in the Fitzcarrald area. The occurrence of \ntidal deposits since the Middle Miocene is marked by an increase \nin the subsidence rates from 40 to 90 m/million years at the base \nof the Ipururo Formation and the sedimentation rate increased \nfrom 50 to ~160 m/million years. The Ipururo Formation accu-\nmulated during a period of ongoing tectonic loading and recorded \na strong increase of the sedimentation rate (see Chapter 5). This \nmajor change in the geodynamic context of the Amazonian fore-\nland basins is related to the growth of the Andes and the eastern \npropagation of the sub-Andean thrust front (see Chapters 4 & 5). \nThese results indicate that the Fitzcarrald Arch did not exist in \nMiddle and Late Miocene times. Instead, the Fitzcarrald area was",

This ﬂ at slab segment reaches \nthe Amazonian foreland basin below the Fitzcarrald Arch uplift. \nHampel (2002) showed that the Nazca Ridge subduction below the \nSouth American Plate started 11.2 Ma (Fig. 6.6a). The beginning of \nthe ridge subduction coincides with the onset of the eastward over-\nthrusting of the Eastern Cordillera and sub-Andean zone, north \nof the Fitzcarrald Arch (Hermoza et al. 2005). During the Miocene, \nthe Amazonian foreland basin constituted a single four-component \nforeland basin system (sensu DeCelles & Giles 1996; see Fig. 6.6a). \nThe Fitzcarrald Arch did not exist and the area was subsiding and to-\ntally occupied by tide-dominated deltas and estuaries (see Fig. 6.6a).\nAt the same time, the product of the erosion of the Andes ﬁ lled the \nwestern Amazonian drainage basin (Roddaz 2004).\nThe buoyancy of the Nazca Ridge produced a ﬂ at subducting \nslab beginning ~4 Ma, according to the cessation of arc volcanism \n(see Fig. 6.6b) (Soler & Bonhomme 1990; Rosenbaum et al. 2005). \nThe coincidence of the initiation of ﬂ at slab subduction (Gutscher \net al. 2000) with uplift of the Fitzcarrald Arch leads us to inter-\npret the ﬂ at subduction of the Nazca Ridge as the cause of uplift \n(Espurt et al. 2007).

        "text": "The Amazon drainage basin is a highly heterogeneous region in \nwhich, from the Miocene to the present day, geological history, \nlandscape, climate, soils and biota have been closely related to \nlarge-scale subduction processes of the Nazca-South America con-\nvergence system (Roddaz 2004). Before 4 Ma, the role of the Nazca \nRidge subduction seems to have been restricted to the Andes (e.g. \nHampel 2002; McNulty & Farber 2002; Rousse et al. 2003) and the \nridge does not inﬂ uence the Amazonian foreland basin develop-\nment (see Fig. 6.6a). In contrast, Pliocene-Pleistocene landscape \nevolution of the western Amazonian foreland basin coincides \nwith the onset of the Nazca Ridge ﬂ at subduction (see Fig. 6.6b) \n(Espurt et al. 2007). Thus, the geomorphic Fitzcarrald Arch \nregional uplift may have induced large-scale modiﬁ cations of \nthe hydrological, erosional and sedimentological processes in the \nAmazon drainage basin since the Pliocene. The modern drainage \nnetwork of the Fitzcarrald Arch eroded Neogene sediments away \nfrom an area greater than 400,000 km2(see Fig. 6.2). These erosive \nprocesses induced new rivers in the Fitzcarrald Arch area, which \nare noticeably enriched in smectite, indicating strong recycling of \nMiocene sediments (Guyot et al. 2007). In any budget related to \nAndean erosion, the suspended sediment yields from the erosion \nof the Fitzcarrald Arch must be taken into account in order not to \noverestimate the erosion rates of the Andes.\nTropical rainforests are well known for their high biodiversity \n(Groombridge 1992; Hooghiemstra & Van der Hammen 1998). \nThe Fitzcarrald Arch uplift could have played a major role in the \ndistribution patterns of the modern Amazon biota (e.g. Lougheed \net al. 1999; Patton et al. 2000; Montufar & Pintaud 2006). Indeed, \nthe uplift and dissection of sedimentary series of the Fitzcarrald \nArch created a dynamic edaphic mosaic in the area that sustained \nhigh diversity.\nThe Neogene geological formations outcropping on the \nFitzcarrald Arch area are various and complex, and have dis-\ntinctive lithological (e.g. Miocene Madre de Dios clays vs \nPliocene-Pleistocene conglomerates), hydrological and geochem-\nical characteristics (Guyot et al. 2007) with associated fertile soils. \nThis edaphic control probably induces a distinct ﬂ oral and faunal \ndevelopment, such as endemic species (e.g. Linna 2001; Klemola \n2003; Ruokolainen et al. 2005), and probably controls the activities \nof autochthonous tribes (Hovikoski et al. 2007). At about 8 Ma, \nthe modern eastward Amazon River system had become estab-\nlished (Hoorn et al. 1995; Dobson et al. 1997, 2001; Wesselingh & \nSalo 2006). The Fitzcarrald Arch uplift has created a formidable \nNE–SW-trending barrier within the Amazonian lowland forest \nsince Pliocene times. This uplift also contributed to producing a \ndrained area and may have permitted the development of isolated",
