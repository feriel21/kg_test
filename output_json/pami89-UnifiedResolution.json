        "text": "A picture will be represented by a set of piwels in the plane. Each \npixel can have a gray level in the range [ 0, . . . , N 1, and is rep- \nresented by Npebbles. When the gray-level of pixel i is gi we as- \nsume that pixel i has g, “white” \npebbles and N - g, “black” \npeb- \nbles. A picture is then regarded as a collection of pebbles, some \nwhite and some black, which are placed on the plane only at pixel \nlocations, exactly N pebbles per pixel. \nA matching OAB is a one to one mapping between the pictures A \nand B, i.e., each pebble of A is matched to a pebble of B having \nthe same color. A matching is therefore defined only between pic- \ntures with same number of black (and white) pebbles, pictures with \nequal sums of gray level. \nThe cost of a matching OAB, 4 : Oas + \n+, is a function from \nmatchings to the nonnegative real numbers. Examples of reason- \nable cost functions for matchings are CCa,,h,)EB,,B \n/a, - b, 1; C(a, - \nb,)*; h.fu.~ { I a, - b, 1 } where /a, - b, / is the distance between the \nlocations of pebbles a, and b,. A matching OAB can be regarded as \nan algorithm to change picture A into picture B: for each (a,, b, ) E \nBAB, move pebble a, E A to the location of b,. The cost of this single \npebble move is j a, - b, (. The cost of the matching can be regarded \nas the cost of the entire transformation of A and B, and is computed \nfrom the costs of individual movements in one of the three ways \ndescribed earlier (sum, sum of squares, or max). \nLet 8 be the set of all matchings between pictures A and B, and \nlet 0 E 8 be of minimal cost. This minimal cost matching will be \ncalled the transformation of A and B, and the cost d( eAB) will be \ncalled the match-distance between A and B and denoted by p (A, \nB). The transformation is not always unique, and in such cases can \nbe chosen arbitrarily from all minimal cost candidates. The match- \ndistance is unique with respect to the cost function $. \nWhen two pictures have same number of pixels as well as peb- \nbles. it is enough to consider the white pebbles only. Let (a,, b,) \nbe a pair of white pebbles in the minimal matching, designating a \nmove of one white pebble from a, to B,. As each pixel has N peb- \nbles, there is a minimal matching with a black pebble from the \nlocation of b, moved back to the location of a,. (a,, b,) E OAB can \ntherefore be regarded as an exchange of a white pebble from the \nlocation of a, and a black pebble from the location of b,, leaving \nthe total number of pebbles at each pixel unchanged. \nExample: We will compute the distance p = C la, - b, 1 for the \nfollowing three pictures:",

However, image resolution \nhas an additional \naspect: gray level, \nor color, resolution. \nColor resolution \nhas traditionally \nbeen considered \nin the area of computer \ngraphics. \nBy defining a suitable measure for the comparison \nof images, changes \nin resolution \ncan be treated \nwith the same tools as changes in color \nresolution. \nA gray tone image, for example, can be compared to a half- \ntone image having only two colors \n(black \nand white), \nbut of higher \nspatial resolution. \nAn important \napplication \ncan be in pyramids, \none of the most com- \nmonly used multiple \n(spatial) \nresolution \nschemes, where this approach \nprovides a tool to change the color resolution \nas well. Increasing \ncolor \nresolution \nwhile reducing \nspatial resolution \nto retain more image de- \ntails and prevent aliasing is an example of the possibility \nto find optimal \ncombinations \nof resolution \nreduction, \nspatial and color, to best fit an \napplication.",

        "text": "I. INTRODUCTION \nThe process of image digitization: creating a digital picture from \na continuous image, involves two stages. One stage is image sam- \npling, which determines the spatial resolution of a picture, and the \nsecond is image quantization, which determines the gray-level res- \nolution at each pixel [6], [7]. Each of these stages had been treated \nseparately, and multiresolution approaches in computer vision [8] \nas well as in signal processing [2] consider only spatial resolution. \nA method introduced earlier to measure distances between his- \ntograms [lo] is the basis to a unified treatment of spatial and gray- \nlevel resolution. This measure has also been found useful for re- \nduction of gray-level resolution [3], and in this paper we present \nits applicability to the change of spatial resolution as well. \nThe ability to manipulate both spatial and gray-level resolutions \ncan be very useful in several computer vision applications. Many \npyramid algorithms, for example, use the effect that objects arbi- \ntrarily far away in the image eventually become local at one of the \npyramid’s levels. But spatial resampling usually has aliasing effects \nwhich introduce information \nnot in the original image. These \naliasing effects can be greatly reduced by increasing the color rcs- \nolution while decreasing the spatial resolution. In other applica- \ntions, if resolution is being reduced for compression purposes, it \nis beneficial to consider for a given compression rate the best com- \nbination of resolution reduction in both space and gray level. \nIn Section II, we introduce a graph-theoretical definition of the \nbasic measure used. This will be followed by application to spatial \nresampling in Section III, and gray-level requantization in Section \nIV. Section V presents a hybrid treatment of space and gray-level \nresolutions.",

We use the match-distance to measure the quality of \nreduction of gray-level resolution, enabling the comparison of gray- \nlevel resolution to spatial resolution as will be done in the next \nchapter. \nThis requantization method, first described in [3], can take an \nimage in any gray-level range and transform it optimally to another \nimage of the same size in any desired gray-level range. The benefit \nof this process is the cost it associates for the requantization. Such \ncost is unavailable with other requantization methods. The com- \nputational cost of arbitrary gray-level changes is high. More com- \nputationally efficient is the subproblem of the reduction of the gray- \nlevel range from [ 0, \n. , 2 N ] to [ 0, \n. , N 1. Repetition of \nthis process will result in a binary halftone. \nGiven a picture with gray-level range of [0, . \n, 2 N], reduc- \ning the gray-level range to [ 0, . . \n, N ] is equivalent to leaving \nthe range [0, . . . , 2N], but having only even gray levels, i.e.. \n[O-2,4, \n. . , 2N].Changingfromrangeof[0,2,4, \n... \n,2N] \nto [O, . . . ) N ] is accomplished easily using a division by two. In \norder to change all gray levels to be even, only pixels with odd \ngray levels are considered. We pair together such pixels, and they \nexchange within each pair a white pebble for a black pebble. After \nsuch exchange, both pixels in the pair get an even gray level. We \nshould remember that the gray level is also the number of white \npebbles at a pixel. \nThe pairing of pixels with odd gray levels is done minimizing \nits cost: minimize the sum, over all pairs, of pairwise distances. \nAs pairwise distances WC consider the distance between the two \npixels of the pair where the distance can be Euclidean, chessboard. \ncity block, etc. \nThe algorithm for reducing the gray-level range from [0, . . \n. \n2N] to [0, . . . , N ] is summarized as follows. \n1) Optimally pair pixels with odd gray level. Algorithms for \nsuch pairing will be discussed later. \n2) In all pairs, exchange one white pebble for a black pebble. \nThe cost of such pairwise exchange is twice the distance between \nthe pixels in the pair. After this step all gray levels are even. \n3) Divide the gray levels by two.",

K . 0. \nWe multiply the number of pebbles in each pixel of X by 01 (and \nhave N . 01 pebbles per pixel), and the number of pebbles in each \npixels of Y by fl (to have K . 6 pebbles per pixel ). We then map \n(a minimal cost mapping) the pebbles of X and Y. We perform this \nmapping under the constraint that pixels in Y get only k . /3, (k = \n0. I, . . . ) K ) white pebbles. With this constraint, simple division \nof the number of pebbles in Y by p will result in the desired range \nof K pebbles per pixel. Without this constraint the division would \nresult in fractions of white and black pebbles. \nThe complexity of the algorithm to solve the mapping described \nabove is very high, and at this moment we do not have an efficient \nalgorithm to perform it completely. To get approximated results \nwe use two stages. In the first stage, we change the spatial reso- \nlution using the linear program of Section III, and get N . ( X / \npebbles at each pixel of Y. In the second stage, we use the halfton- \ning technique of Section IV to reduce the number of pebbles to the \ndesired K. Actually, if K 2 N, simple division is satisfactory. Only \nwhen K < N we have to use the halftoning technique. \nFig. 3-4 show combined application of space and gray level res- \nolutions. Fig. 3 displays a portrait, while Fig. 4 is a texture picture.",

        "text": "Image sequences capture not only static, but also dynamic aspects \nof a recorded scene. The evaluation or coding of image sequences \ntherefore requires algorithms for extraction and interpretation of \ndynamic relations between successive frames in an image se- \nquence, such as velocity and shape of moving brightness patterns, \nas well as, changes in illumination. \nAlgorithms facilitating \nthe extraction of the above mentioned \nfeatures from the pixel information can be split in two basic cate- \ngories. The first class of algorithms is based on the iterative com- \nputation and evaluation of optical flow fields [l]-[6] \nwhich de- \nscribe the distribution \nof apparent velocities of movement of \nbrightness patterns in an image. Consequently, discontinuities in \nthe optical flow can help segmenting images into regions that cor- \nrespond to different objects [2], [3], [5]. In the optical flow con- \ncept, an inherent difficulty arises when the illumination \nchanges \nwith time. In this case, the continuity equation of optical flow [I] \nis violated which can cause serious errors in the estimated optical \nflow (displacement vector) field. \nTherefore, a second class of scene modeling algorithms which \nderives from the idea of correlating matching [7] has gained con- \nsiderable importance. Recall that various types of different \nblock \nmatching (BM) algorithms [7]-[9] \nhave been applied with great \nsuccess in the domain of image sequence coding. The closer anal- \nysis presented in this paper reveals that a larger number of recently \nproposed BM algorithms appear as special cases of a more general \nimage sequence model \nin which \nthe \nrelationship \nbetween \ntwo \nsuc- \ncessive frames in a sequence is modeled by a rccjo-dimmsionul block \nuduptive leust-squares joint proce.ss$lter [ lo]-[ 121. This approach \ncan also be brought in relation with some previous work of other \nauthors where linear predictiorz Nzvdels were applied with great \nsuccess on the problem of intrufrume (in-field) image coding [13], \n[l4]. \nAs an important novelty, we present the embedding of the \ndescribed linear prediction models in an uduptive quadtree seg- \nmentation structure [ l5]-[ 171 which helps to handle spatial non- \nstationarities. In this concept. two segmentation rules arc dis- \ncussed. This is, first, a simple minimum variance detector and, \nsecond, we have extended the well-known generu/i:ed likelihood \nratio (GLR) \ndetector \nof Willsky \nand \nJones \n[ 181 to the problem \nof \nchange detection and spatial segmentation. \nThe correspondence is organized as follows. In Section II, we \nprovide the necessary definitions and properties to aid in the un- \nderstanding of the subsequent sections. A constrained joint process \nmodel is used for modeling of the relationships between subsequent \nimages in a scene. In Section III, we present several approaches on \nthe important problem of segmenting the interframe information \ninto stationary regions of uniform size and shape utilizing a quud- \nfree segmentation structure. Section IV discusses two applications \nof the theoretical results obtained in the earlier sections.",
