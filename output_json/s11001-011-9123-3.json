The Ligurian Basin experienced recently such\nphenomena: in 1979, a submarine failure (8 9 106 m3)\noccurred in shallow-water depth during inﬁlling operations\nseaward of the Nice airport (Gennesseaux et al. 1980) and\ngenerated three successive waves, 2–3 m high, that broke\nalong the coastline between the cities of Nice and Antibes.\nThree historical tsunamis are also well-known in the area\n(1564, 1818, 1887 AD) and are closely related to historical\nearthquake events. Earthquakes could have been respon-\nsible for tsunamogenic failures in the Ligurian Sea, as\npreviously described in other margin settings (Fryer et al.\n2004; Lo`pez-Venegas et al. 2008).\nThe present study focuses on the northern margin of the\nLigurian Sea where more than 500 submarine failures of\nvarious sizes have been identiﬁed on the continental slope\nbetween the cities of Nice (France) and Genova (Italy). To\nanalyse their morphologies and distribution on the slope,\nand to identify their triggering mechanisms, a large dataset\nincluding Simrad EM300 multibeam bathymetry, seismic-\nreﬂection proﬁles, echo-sounder proﬁles and deep-tow\nside-scan sonar was acquired in the frame of the MALI-\nSAR cruises (2006, 2007, 2008). Our goal is to present the\ncharacters of the continental slope to outline the main\nfeatures of the submarine failures and factors controlling\ntheir distribution. These results will help improving our\nability to predict such geohazards along the Ligurian\nMargin and every margins with a similar environmental\ncontext.",

Particles are delivered to the Var\nsystem through two canyons, the Var and Paillon canyons,\ndirectly connected to rivers on land. Sediments are then\ndistributed on the slope via gravity-ﬂow processes or via\nthe decantation of surface plumes (Klaucke et al. 2000).\nThe Var and Paillon canyons coalesce at 1,600 m of water\ndepth and merge into a single submarine valley about\n170-km long (Migeon et al. 2006). In its middle part, the\nVar Valley exhibits an East–West trend, and it is bordered\nto the south by a thick sediment accumulation, the Var\nSedimentary Ridge.\nAlthough the present-day morphology of the margin\nmainly results from Plio-Quaternary sedimentary pro-\ncesses, it has also been shaped by a sea-level lowering of\nabout\n1,500 m\nduring\nthe\nMessinian\nSalinity\nCrisis\n(*5.96–5.32 Ma). The Messinian deposits marks a rele-\nvant step in the geological history of the Mediterranean.\nTheir depocenter is partially controlled by inherited\nmorphology, as demonstrated in cases where the pre-\nMessinian deposits are imaged in seismic proﬁles (Bertoni\nand Cartwright 2006; Strzerzynski et al. 2010). On the\nMediterranean margins, the Messinian sea-level lowering\nwas responsible for the incision of canyons on the slope\nand the deposition of conglomerates at the base of the\nslope (Loﬁet al. 2005; Sage et al. 2005). In the deep\nbasin, it resulted in the deposition of thick evaporite\nlayers (Hsu et al. 1973).\nThe northern Ligurian margin is fed by numerous\nsmall mountain-supplied rivers, like the Var, Paillon,\nRoya, Taggia, Argentina, Arroscia, and Lavagna rivers.\nThe largest one, the Var river, forms in the southwestern\nAlps, at 2,352 m of altitude and 120 km inland, and\ndrains a 2,822 km2 catchment basin (Mulder et al. 1996).\nThese rivers experience abrupt ﬂash ﬂoods during fall\nand spring seasons. The average water discharge of the\nVar river, about 50 m3/s, can increase tenfold during\nﬂoods, and suspended sediment concentration can reach\ntens of kg/m3. From the rating curve of the Var river,\nMulder et al. (1998) estimated that hyperpycnal currents\ncould be generated during river ﬂoods, with a return\nperiod of about 2–5 years. Such turbulent ﬂows are\ngenerated at river mouth when the density of fresh water\ntransporting suspended particles exceeds the density of\nthe ambient sea water. Thick ﬁne-grained beds resulting\nfrom surface-plume deposition (Klaucke et al. 2000), and\ncoarser but thinner inversely graded beds resulting from\nhyperpycnal ﬂows (Mulder et al. 2001a) have been\ndescribed on the slope offshore of Nice, as well as at\ngreater water depth in the basin (Migeon et al. 2001).\nSedimentation rates related to the activity of hyperpycnal\nﬂows can be as high as 1–2 m/100 years (Mulder et al.\n2001b).",

        "text": "The Ligurian basin is thought to originate from backarc\nextension related to the convergence between the European\nand African plates (Jolivet and Faccenna 2000). The Oligo-\nMiocene Ligurian rifting phase was followed by oceanic\naccretion between 20.5 and 18–15 Ma, responsible for the\n30\u0003 counterclockwise rotation of the Corsica-Sardinia\nblock (Re´hault et al. 1984; Rollet et al. 2002). On land,\nsome ancient and active faults exhibit a NW–SE trend\ncorresponding to the direction of transfer faults that guided\nthe rifting (Larroque et al. 2001). At sea, the continuity of\nthe faults has not already been observed but the steep\nmargin is incised by numerous canyons that could follow\ntheir direction (Chaumillon et al. 1994).\nHistorical and instrumental seismicity is mainly located\nin the western part of the Ligurian margin (from the Cap\nFerrat to Imperia), from the coastline to the base of the\ncontinental slope [Courboulex et al. 1998; Eva et al. 2001;\nLarroque et al. (this issue)]. Some earthquake epicentres\ncorrelate with the location of faults and probably originated\nbetween 5 and 15 km below the seaﬂoor (Courboulex et al.\n1998). The southwestern Alps and the continental margin\nfrom Nice to Imperia experiences a recurrent seismic\nactivity mainly characterised by several moderate and\nsome strong historical earthquake events (1564 AD,\nIntensity MKS I = IX–X; 1644 AD, I = VIII; 1818 AD,\nI = VIII; 1887 AD, I = X) and recent events [1963 AD,\nMagnitude M = 6.0; 1981 AD, M = 4.5; 1985 AD,\nM = 4.1; 1989 AD, M = 4.5; 1995 AD, M = 4.7; 2001\nAD, M = 4.6; (Bakun and Scotti 2006; Chaumillon et al.\n1994; Larroque et al. 2009)]. For the 1887 Ligurian\nearthquake, the macroseismic equivalent of magnitude has\nbeen estimated between 6.2 and 6.7 (Bakun and Scotti\n2006; Ferrari 1991). Among the most recent earthquakes,\nsome of them like the 1963, 1989, 1995 and 2001 events\nattest for reverse and strike-slip faulting (Courboulex et al.\n1998). This suggests a tectonic inversion of the margin\nimplying reactivation of inherited transverse structures and\ndevelopment of new faults (Be´thoux et al. 1992, 2008;\nLarroque et al. 2009). This tectonic reactivation is\nresponsible for an uplift of the margin that is mainly pro-\nnounced offshore the city of Imperia (Italy) (Bigot-Cormier\net al. 2004).",

For the Cirque Marcel, the\nvolume of the accumulation is about 1.3 9 108 m3, i.e. 20\ntimes lower than the total volume of the missing sediment\nin the scar. Seismic-reﬂection proﬁles suggest these large\nfailure-related scars affected in most cases the whole\nPlio-Quaternary section, 300–500-m thick, and the slip\nplans correlate with the top of the Messinian conglomerates\n(Fig. 7). In the ‘‘Cirque Marcel’’, this interpretation is\nsupported by direct observation reporting the presence of\nmessinian-conglomerates\nand\npliocene-marl\noutcrops\nwithin the main scars (Savoye and Piper 1991).\nIn the area offshore Nice to Imperia, the base of the\ncontinental slope is also strongly affected by faults (Figs 2\nand 7). The deepest ones broke and shifted vertically the\nMessinian conglomerates, but the penetration of the\nseismic-reﬂection proﬁles did not allow the observation of\nthese faults at greater depth (Fig. 7). Vertical displace-\nments could be in the order of 300–400 ms (about\n200–300 m). The shallowest faults affect the Plio-Quater-\nnary deposits: some of them are visible on side-scan sonar\nimages of the seaﬂoor (Fig. 6), suggesting a recent activity.",

Because high slope angle\nwill promote regular failure events, it will also prevent\nthick unstable sediment accumulation to build through\ntime. In that case, only small volume of continental-slope\ndeposits will be remobilized during each failure event, as it\nis observed along similar steep margins of the Mediterra-\nnean, like the Algerian margin (Cattaneo et al. 2010).\nSlope angle might also play an important role on the\npost-failure processes and the transformation of a failed\nmass into a gravity ﬂow. Mass-transport deposits are never\nfound immediately downslope of Type-1 and Type-2 scars,\nor they are found far from these scars where the slope angle\ndecreases drastically (Fig. 5), while MTDs are always\nfound downstream of Type-3 scars. This suggests that\nslope angles greater than 5–6\u0003 should promote a complete\ndisintegration and evacuation of the failed mass while\nslope angles lower than 4\u0003 should conserve the cohesion of\nthe failed mass. One possible interpretation could come\nfrom a difference in the rheology of the material that could\nbe stiffer and more consolidated on gentler slopes and\nsofter and less consolidated on steeper slopes, also as a\nconsequence of the shorter time of residence/accumulation",

High sed-\nimentation rates related to hyperpycnal ﬂows and gradual\nbasal erosion of canyon walls are thought to be the main\ntrigger mechanism of such failures. By comparison with\nthe effects of the 1979 Nice-airport landslide, Type-1\nfailures with volume lower than 108 m3 and occurring at\nshallow water depth could have a low-to-high hazard\npotential.\nLarge scars corresponding to failures of Type 2 are\nlocated at the base of the continental slope, between 1,700\nand 2,200 m of water depth. Their location correlates with\nthe presence of faults that are also the areas of highest\nearthquake activity. They could result from multi-phase\nmass-wasting events; however, the reconstruction of the\ntiming of such events is still matter of an open debate.\nBecause large volumes (greater than 109 m3) are poten-\ntially remobilized during single failure events, Type-2\nfailures could have a high hazard potential.\nLarge-scale scars, affecting segments of the margin several\nkilometreslong,andMTDsfromfailuresofType3arelocated\natdifferentplacesalongthe Ligurianmargin: onthe upperpart\nof the continental slope or on the Var Ridge in the deep part of\nthe Ligurian basin. Depending on their locations, triggering\nfactors for such landslides could be strong earthquakes,\nsea-level ﬂuctuations, and slow downslope movement of the\nmobile evaporite layer deposited in the deep basin during the\nMessinian Salinity Crisis: a case-by-case approach with\nadditional data is probably necessary to assess the related\ngeohazards for this last type of failures.",
