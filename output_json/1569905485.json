For\nproblems like identical texture retrieval and perceptual image\ncompression, texture features and metrics should be insensi-\ntive to spatial shifts, but penalize rotations monotonically [1].\nExamples of such include Structural Texture Similarity Met-\nrics (STSIM) [2–4] and Local Radius Index (LRI) [5]. Such\nfeatures and metrics have been successfully applied to a num-\nber of applications, e.g., the newly proposed perceptual image\ncompression algorithm Matched Texture Coding (MTC) [6].\nHowever, for texture classiﬁcation, an active area of research,\nrotation invariance is needed. In this paper we propose a mod-\niﬁcation of LRI that makes it rotation-invariant, while main-\ntaining its low complexity.\nA common approach to texture classiﬁcation uses tex-\nture features and metrics, along with classiﬁcation algorithms\nbased on nearest neighbor search of a dictionary of labeled\ntexture patterns. For example, some methods are based on\nco-occurrence matrices [7–9], which count the numbers of\npairs of pixels with various displacements and intensities.

Besides spatial domain\nanalysis, many metrics have been developed in a transform\ndomain, including those based on Gabor ﬁlters [17, 18] and\nsteerable pyramid subband decompositions [2–4,19].\nRecently, Local Binary Patterns (LBP) [20], proposed in\n2002 as a new statistical texture feature, has drawn a lot of at-\ntention. LBP is training-free and considers rotation-invariant\nlocal neighborhood information.\nIt achieves good texture\nclassiﬁcation performance with relatively few computations\nin the spatial domain. Subsequently, many additional texture\nfeatures have been motivated by LBP, such as Dominant LBP\n(DLBP) [21] and Completed LBP (CLBP) [22]. In addition,\nmany complementary texture features have been combined\nwith LBP to attain better performance, including Dominant\nNeighborhood Structure (DNS) [23], Enhanced Binary Cod-\ning (LEBC) [24], and LRI [5]. In this paper, a new texture\nsimilarity feature for classiﬁcation, called rotation-invariant\nLRI (RI-LRI), and corresponding similarity metrics are pro-\nposed.\nRI-LRI is developed based on the version of LRI\ncalled LRI-A [5] and is complementary to LBP. As will be\nshown in this paper, when combined with frequency domain\ncontrast information and LBP, the RI-LRI texture similarity\nmetric attains classiﬁcation performance comparable to state-\nof-the-art metrics, when tested on the Outex and CUReT\ndatabases. Moreover, the low dimensionality of LRI carries\nover to RI-LRI, resulting in a method whose feature vector di-\nmension is approximately ten times less than state-of-the-art\nmethods in [24] and requires substantially less computation.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.\nSec. 2\nreviews the recently proposed Local Radius Index (LRI).\nRotation-invariant LRI (RI-LRI) is proposed in Sec. 3.\nIn\nSec. 4, RI-LRI is combined with other texture features to\nexploit their complementarity.

As we found\nfrom experiments, most of the distinctive information is con-\ntained in the dominant direction, the opposite direction, and\nthe two orthogonal directions. In addition, the two orthog-\nonal directions contain correlated information, which can be\nbeneﬁcially exploited using a two-dimensional histogram. To\nbe concrete, starting with the dominant direction and moving\ncounter clockwise, we label the directions as 1, 2, . . . , 8. We\nclaim that most of the information is included in directions\n1,3,5 and 7. Moreover, orthogonal directions 1 and 3 contain\ncorrelated information, as do orthogonal directions 5 and 7.",

Each test suite contains 24 texture classes obtained\nunder three illumination conditions (“horizon”,“inca” and\n“t184”) and nine orientations (0 ◦, 5 ◦, 10 ◦, 15 ◦, 30 ◦, 45 ◦,\n60 ◦, 75 ◦and 90 ◦). For each texture class, under each illu-\nmination and rotation condition, there are 20 non-overlapped\n128 × 128 texture samples. The experiment is based on a\nnearest neighbor classiﬁer with a “dictionary” composed of\nTC10 “inca” images with orientation 0◦. Three classiﬁcation\nresults are reported based on different testing images, namely\nthe remaining “inca” samples in TC10, “t184” and “horizon”\nsamples in TC12.\nMetric performance is measured by classiﬁcation accu-\nracy.\nTable 2 shows experimental results for our methods\nbased on our experiments, as well as for other methods based\non performance reported in [20–24]. The ﬁrst two lines show\nthe performance of LBPriu2\n8,1\nand RI-LRI with K = 4, which\nare the two simplest and the most basic metrics. The results\nshow that although RI-LRI is computationally more efﬁcient,\nits classiﬁcation accuracy signiﬁcantly outperforms LBP. Be-\ncause of its simplicity, RI-LRI could be added to existing or\nfuture texture similarity metrics without increasing complex-\nity. Starting from the third line, the results of more sophis-\nticated metrics are shown, with LEBC and RI-LRI+ being\nthe best. While LEBC appears to have slightly better perfor-\nmance than RI-LRI+, its 1280-dimensional feature vector is\nmuch larger than the 139-dimensional RI-LRI+ feature vec-\ntor, resulting in much higher computational complexity.",

This is consistent with the result from the\nOutex database. LEBC has the best performance on aver-\nage, with RI-LRI+ and VZ-MR8 not far behind. However,\nwhen the standard deviation of classiﬁcation accuracy is con-\nsidered, the three methods actually have similar performance.\nWhen feature dimension is considered, the 139-dimensional\nRI-LRI+ feature vector is signiﬁcantly more compact than\nthe 960-dimensional VZ-MR8 feature vector and the 1280-\ndimensional LEBC feature vector. In short, the proposed RI-\nLRI+ has comparable performance with the state-of-art met-\nric, LEBC, with a much lower dimensional feature vector, and\ncorrespondingly less complexity.",
