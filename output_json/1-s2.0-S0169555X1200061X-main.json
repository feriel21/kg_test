However, the modeling of multiple hazards in a joint analysis scheme is still in the early\nstages of development as a range of serious challenges emerges in the multihazard context such as differing\nmodeling approaches in use for contrasting hazards; the time- and data-demanding conduct of each single\npreparative, intermediate and analysis step; and the clear visualization of the modeling outcome. Under con-\nsideration of these difﬁculties, a regional multihazard exposure analysis concept is developed for ﬁve natural\nhazards: debris ﬂows, rock falls, shallow landslides, avalanches, and river ﬂoods, complemented by a visual-\nization scheme to present the modeling outcome. An automation of the two schemes resulted in a beta ver-\nsion of the MultiRISK modeling and the MultiRISK visualization software tool forming together the MultiRISK\nplatform. To test the analysis scheme and the software implementation of MultiRISK a case study is per-\nformed in the Barcelonnette basin in France with a worst-case parameterization of the models on the basis\nof extensive literature reviews. Experiences from this case study offered many insights into the multihazard\ntopic and even more questions, e.g. with respect to coherent multihazard model parameterization, validation\nor the comparability and interpretation of single-hazard modeling results, respectively. Although analysis\nschemes can be proposed and software tools can be provided to facilitate many steps, a well-conceived\nand reﬂective approach to multihazard settings is essential. The worst-case analysis based on literature\nvalues apparently leads to an overestimation of the susceptible areas and the number of exposed elements.\nNevertheless, depending on the data situation of an area, especially in areas without any information on\npast events, this approach may offer the determination of general hazard distributions, overlaps, and areas\nof potential risk without data-demanding calibration.\n© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, re-running the analysis repeatedly would be de-\nsirable in order to evaluate, e.g., the effect of management options\nor to consider changes in land use, in the climate, in the general envi-\nronmental setting, or in alterations of the elements at risk (Dai et al.,\n2002; Fuchs and Keiler, 2006; Slaymaker and Embleton-Hamann,\n2009).\nA possible approach considering these challenges is the selection\nof methods according to previously deﬁned criteria, and their subse-\nquent merging in one software tool in which preparative and inter-\nmediate steps are automated. Such a procedure leads to comparable\nsingle-hazard results since the single hazards are analyzed according\nto a coherent analysis scheme, and result in a higher time and effort\nefﬁciency for the user by automatically performing purely elementary\nsteps. Although still expert input from different disciplines is needed\nto calibrate the models, profound knowledge on existing methods\nand models for the choice of the approaches is not necessarily re-\nquired as they are included in the software tool. Current pioneer ap-\nproaches include HAZUS in the USA (Schneider and Schauer, 2006;\nFEMA, 2008), that offers hurricane, earthquake and ﬂood hazard\nand risk modeling. RiskScape in New Zealand (Reese et al., 2007) fa-\ncilitates currently volcanic ashfalls, ﬂoods, tsunamis, landslides,\nstorms, and earthquakes. CAPRA (Central America Probabilistic Risk\nAssessment) provides the analysis of hurricanes, heavy rainfalls, land-\nslides,\nﬂoods,\nearthquakes,\ntsunamis,\nand\nvolcanic\nhazards\n(CEPREDENAC et al., 2010). Such tools enable user-friendly and\nstraightforward performance of multihazard analyses and compara-\nbility between single hazards, furthermore their widespread and re-\npeated\nuse\nalso\nguarantees\ncomparability\nbetween\nresults\nof\nanalysis from different municipalities or departments and between\nanalysis results over time.\nA ﬁnal issue in the multihazard context is the huge data require-\nment. Extensive and qualitatively high standard inventories of past\nevents – including detailed spatiotemporal patterns, particularly\nwith an equivalent standard for multiple hazards – are rare. In most\nregions huge differences in quality and dimension exist between the\nsingle-hazard inventories — if records of past events are available at\nall. Furthermore, the more detailed the models, the more detailed\ndata on topography, geology, soils, land use, precipitation distribu-\ntion, etc. is required. A possibility to partly overcome these con-\nstraints is a top-down approach. Thereby, a simple and fast analysis\napproach at a small scale provides an approximation. In a next step,\nmore\ndetailed\nand\nsophisticated\n(and\nthus\nalso\nmore\ndata-\nrequiring) methods at a larger scale are applied. By using the small-\nscale modeling results to deﬁne those areas for which detailed studies\nhave to be carried out, resources can be utilized very efﬁciently.\nUnder consideration of the previously mentioned challenges, the\nMultiRISK platform has been designed. This software is projected to\noffer the analysis of multihazard risk according to a top-down ap-\nproach, in relation with a visualization tool to display the results. In\nthe current version of MultiRISK, the GIS-based regional-scale suscep-\ntibility and exposure analysis (elements at risk) is completed\n(1:10,000–1:50,000) for the typical mountain hazards avalanches,\ndebris ﬂows, rock falls, shallow landslides, and river ﬂoods. In the\nnext step detailed vulnerability considerations and risk analyses at a\nscale b1:10,000 will be implemented (cf. Kappes et al., 2011b for a\nﬁrst attempt regarding vulnerability in the context of multihazard\nrisk). Therefore, the name MultiRISK platform is chosen although\nuntil now only susceptibility/hazard and exposure analysis can be\ncarried out by applying the current version of the tool while the\nvulnerability of elements is not taken into consideration so far. The\napplied scale levels correspond to the approaches used in several\nalpine countries such as Germany, France and Switzerland with\nhazard\nindication\nmaps\n(Gefahrenhinweiskarten)\nat\nthe\nscale\n1:10,000–1:25,000 and the hazard zone plans b1:10,000 (Stötter et\nal., 1999). Thereby, the hazard indication maps comprise an overlay\nof susceptibility maps and elements at risk and provide a ﬁrst",

Shallow landslides\nIn contrast to the processes treated until now, areas susceptible\nto shallow landslides are usually analyzed with statistical and physi-\ncally based methods rather than with empirical models.

Nevertheless, a va-\nriety of physical models were adjusted to the input of information de-\nrived from DEMs. Because topographic characteristics control water\nconﬂuence, downslope forces, etc. this effort proved to be successful\nas multiple models indicate, e.g. SLIDISP of Liener and Kienholz\n(2000), SHALSTAB of Montgomery and Dietrich (1994) and Dietrich\nand Montgomery (1998), or SMORPH of Shaw and Johnson (1995).\nAmong these methods, SHALSTAB (SHAllow Landsliding STABility;\nMontgomery and Greenberg, 2009) was selected because it offers\nthe option to compute a ﬁrst approximation of an area without the\nneed of detailed calibration.

Models representing hydrodynamic characteristics\nsuch as HEC-RAS (US Army Corps of Engineers, 2011), Sobek\n(Deltares, 2011), and others need more detailed information on chan-\nnel geometry and roughness, hydrograph information, etc. The ArcGIS\nextension FloodArea of Geomer (2008) offers both methods: model-\ning on the basis of a certain inundation depth or by means of a hydro-\ngraph and several more options. In the modeling scheme of the\nMultiRISK software both options were included to offer a choice\ndepending on the quantity and type of data available for the model\ncalibration/parameterization.\nThe combination of the previously described single-hazard models\nto one overall analysis scheme is challenging. However, it is evident\nthat different natural hazard models require similar data, and therefore\nthe combination of these models in a multihazard analysis provides a\nmajor advantage in order to gain synergies and consequently time-\nsavings in a joint study. The ﬂow chart of the resulting model setup is\npresented in Fig. 2.",

        "text": "Because comprehensive event inventories at a comparable quality\nand extent for a multitude of hazards are scarce, not only the calibra-\ntion/parameterization of the models but also the validation has to be\nﬂexible concerning the input of information on past events. Because\nof their simplicity, confusion matrices as described by Beguería\n(2006) and Carranza and Castro (2006) meet exactly this need.\nThey are based on an overlay of the binary (yes/no) layer containing\nthe modeling result with the layer of the recorded events. The models\ndescribed in the previous section produce directly binary source maps\nwhile the runout computations yield spatial probability and kinetic\nenergy, respectively, and the ﬂood modeling outputs the inundation\ndepth. Reclassifying the continuous results, binary maps were pro-\nduced. Two options of validation of the modeled source and of valida-\ntion of the complete area as a composite of the modeled sources and\nrunout are given. Since, especially in the case of shallow landslides, a\nclear differentiation between source area and runout is often not pos-\nsible this division in sources and complete area seems to be much\nmore practical than to differentiate between sources and runout.\nFurthermore, river ﬂooding cannot be subdivided into source and\nrunout zone; however, the area susceptible to ﬂoods can be perfectly\nassigned to the complete category.\nFrom the overlay of the modeling results and the recorded\nevents, four classes emerge. In these classes, the totality of pixels\nis classiﬁed and the numbers are depicted in a confusion matrix\n(Table 1).\nThe true positives (TP) refer to the recorded events that were cor-\nrectly modeled as threatened, while the false negatives (FN) draw at-\ntention to those zones that were missed by the model. The false\npositives (FP) are de facto not errors but “cases highly propense to de-\nvelop the dangerous characteristic in the future” (Beguería, 2006, p.\n322). The identiﬁcation of these areas in which still no events took\nplace, but a high potential for future incidences exists, is the objective\nof hazard modeling. However, a too conservative modeling approach",

The study area exhibits (i) a mountain climate with pro-\nnounced interannual rainfall variability (735±400 mm) and 130\nfreezing days per year, (ii) continental inﬂuence with large intraday\nthermal amplitudes (>20°) and multitudinous freeze–thaw cycles,\nand (iii) Mediterranean inﬂuence with summer rainstorms providing\noccasionally more than 50 mm/h (Flageollet et al., 1999; Maquaire et\nal., 2003; Kappes et al., 2011a). Apart from summer rainstorms, heavy\nprecipitation onto melting snow accumulations in spring result in\nhigh discharge (Flageollet et al., 1999). Mesoclimatic differences\nemerge because of the east–west orientation of the valley, especially\nbetween the north- and south-facing slopes. Geologically, the valley\npresents a structural window with autochtonous Callovo-Oxfordian\nblack marls (the ‘Terres Noires’) below allochtonous Autapie and Par-\npaillon ﬂysch (Évin, 1997; Maquaire et al., 2003).\nThe geological setting is reﬂected in the speciﬁc morphology. The\nupper slopes between 1900 and 3000 m asl are composed by thrust\nsheets of cataclastic calcareous sandstones and exhibit slope angles\nsteeper than 45°. These slopes are partly covered by layers of noncon-\nsolidated debris with thickness ranging between 0.5 and 5 m. The\nlower slopes from 1100 to 1900 m asl consist of Callovo-Oxfordian\nblack marls, fragile plates, and ﬂakes in a clayey matrix that are\nmuch gentler with slope angles between 10 and 30°. These slopes\nare mostly covered by Quaternary deposits as poorly sorted debris\nat taluses, moraine deposits, or landslide material (Kappes et al.,\n2011a).\nThe situation and the speciﬁc characteristics of the basin give rise\nto the occurrence of several natural hazards. A large number of river\nﬂoods produced by the Ubaye are recorded with major events in\n1856 and 1957 (Le Carpentier, 1963; Sivan, 2000). Likewise, the tor-\nrents are very active, Remaître (2006) collected information from\n~100 debris ﬂows and 461 ﬂash ﬂoods in the period between 1850\nand 2004. Three large earthﬂows (Super Sauze, La Vallette, and\nPoche) pose a threat of possible unexpected mobilization and release\nof debris ﬂows (Malet et al., 2004). In the year 2000, about 250 active\nrotational and translational landslides were mapped by Thiery et al.\n(2004). Although rock falls occur predominantly in the higher parts\nof the valley, several low-lying regions, for example in the municipal-\nity of Jausiers, also are threatened (RTM, 2000). The avalanche inven-\ntories of the ‘Enquête Permanente sur les Avalanches’ (EPA) and ‘Les\nDonnees de la Carte de Localisation des Phéonoènes d'Avalanche’\n(CLPA, MEDD, 2009) indicate a rather high avalanche activity. As in\nthe case of rock falls, however, their concentration is in the upper",

For the statistical computation of a very low frequency\nscenario as, e.g. a 10,000-year event, an extensive inventory is neces-\nsary — if such estimations are possible at all, on the basis of rather\nshort-period inventories. The increase of a certain ﬂood scenario by\na deﬁned inundation depth depends strongly on the speciﬁc mor-\nphology and is not really transferable to other regions. Furthermore,\nthis method is also very problematic if channeled and braided river\nsections alternate, as is the case in the Barcelonnette basin. Therefore,\nthe multiplication of a comparably frequent and thus better assessable\nevent (100-year event) with a certain factor was chosen to determine\nthe discharge of the extreme ﬂood, which is assumed to be a suitable\nequivalent to the worst-case modeling of the other hazards. The\nmodeling was run for 48 h at the constant discharge of the 100-year\nﬂood×1.6 to achieve a steady-state ﬂooding.\nIn Table 2, an overview of the parameters to be deﬁned in the Mul-\ntiRISK modeling tool and the values assumed for the worst-case anal-\nysis in the Barcelonnette basin are compiled.",

In addition to the very conservative modeling approach\nthat underlies worst-case studies, the amount of records within the\ninventories regarding these three processes are particularly small\nand consequently result in low proportions of true positives and\nlow PPP.\nThe positive prediction power of avalanches (~23%) is exceeded\nonly by the ﬂood result (~32%). The same two processes exhibit\nalso the highest sensitivity values. However, the validation results\ncannot be interpreted without considering the hazard type and its\nspeciﬁc characteristics (cf. Fig. 7). One example for a necessary careful\ninterpretation of the validation results is ﬂooding. The positive pre-\ndiction power is high because river ﬂoods take place in the limited\narea of the ﬂoodplain which leads to a high potential that the mod-\neled areas were already covered by a few records of past events. By\ncontrast, the area susceptible to the occurrence of shallow landslides\nis much less restricted to a certain region such as a ﬂoodplain and, ad-\nditionally, landslides will not recur as this is the case for river ﬂoods.\nAccordingly, the false positive proportion of shallow landslides is\nprobably always higher than for ﬂoods because of the described pro-\ncess characteristics. Consequently, PPP values achievable for ﬂood\nmodeling may not be realistic for shallow landslide models. Further-\nmore, ﬂoods, avalanches, rock falls and debris ﬂows are (to a greater\nor lesser extent) recurring events; while shallow landslides may reac-\ntivate but the characteristics differ from the initial failure. These dif-\nferent aspects complicate a clear ranking of the modeling result.\nFor the present study, a clear quality difference is notable, at least\nbetween the avalanche and ﬂood modeling results with comparative-\nly high sensitivity and the outcome of the rock falls, debris ﬂows, and\nshallow landslides computation. A more detailed ranking is difﬁcult\nand depends on the weighting of sensitivity versus the PPP or the\nFN versus TP and objective of the analysis procedure. The suscep-\ntibility of 53% and 57% of the study area to shallow landslides and\navalanches may suggest an overestimation of modeling result, yet\nthe objective was the worst-case scenario. However, the validation\nbased on mostly rather low number of records within the inventories\ndoes not enable a clear judgment.",

Likewise, the rock fall or debris ﬂow with a 1000-year re-\nturn period is a very rough assumption, while much more in\nuse for earthquakes.

While for debris ﬂows or rock falls a large quantity of\nstudies was detected, in the case of shallow landslides only\ntwo articles were found — an indication of the less frequent\nuse of this technique for shallow landslides and possibly a\nlower suitability of this method. The validation results espe-\ncially indicate very well that differences between hazards\nfrom contrasting characteristics cannot simply be overcome\nand comparability is not automatically assured by the applica-\ntion of the same methodology. Differing suitability and applica-\nbility of an approach when used for contrasting processes may\nresult in very distinct model qualities.

This means that solutions have to be found\naccording to the available data and the legislative framework\nrequiring the computation of certain scenarios or the like.\nThereby, expert appraisal seems to be an indispensible compo-\nnent in multihazard analyses. Multihazard information, espe-\ncially regarding inventory data, is probably always fragmentary\nand has to be complemented and pieced together. Nevertheless,\na problem is that only a few experts have real multihazard\nexperience.\n(iii) Although the presented analysis concept is designed as a top-\ndown approach, in this study only the ﬁrst step is outlined:\nthe regional exposure analysis scheme. Nevertheless, in the\nelaboration of a local analysis scheme many additional prob-\nlems will emerge, such as the development of a vulnerability\nanalysis scheme. Depending on the type of hazard, different\nmethods are used such as curves, matrices, or indicator-based\napproaches (Kappes et al., 2011b). For instance, vulnerability\ncurves are frequently applied for ﬂood and earthquake model-\ning but are still not available for rock falls. Thus, the question is\nhow to combine different methods or identify one method\n(e.g., vulnerability matrices) that can be applied for all process-\nes. Moreover the vulnerability is altered by simultaneous or se-\nquential hazard impacts (Kappes et al., 2011b). Furthermore,\nlocal multihazard risk analyses require much detailed informa-\ntion; and although with the regional analysis zones of special\ninterest are identiﬁed, the acquisition of the necessary infor-\nmation for these areas is a challenge.\nAn extension of MultiRISK toward hazard and risk modeling at\na local scale is planned to facilitate detailed examination of\nthose areas determined at a regional scale. Moreover, the in-\nclusion of further processes as, for instance, earthquakes and\nﬂash ﬂoods is under consideration.\n(iv) Important phenomena arising in a multihazard context are re-\nlations and interactions between hazards. This issue has not\nbeen dealt with in this article due to two reasons: ﬁrst, because\nhazard relations are, until now, not automated in the MultiRISK\nmodeling tool, they were not presented in the present study.\nNevertheless, ideas and recommendations for regarding this\nissue at a regional scale are already presented in Kappes et al.\n(2010) and Kappes and Glade (in press). Primarily, the imple-\nmentation of feedback loops and the identiﬁcation of areas sus-\nceptible to hazard chains with the overlay of modeling results\nare proposed.\n(v) Multihazard analyses have to be followed by the interpretation\nof the results, which especially includes the determination of\nacceptable and tolerable levels of risk for certain types of use\nor the planning of mitigation measures. In Switzerland and\nFrance, broad guidelines for the performance of multihazard\nanalyses already exist, directly linked to the implementation\nof the modeling results into spatial planning. This implies,\nthat any modeling approach has to be adjusted to the legal\nframework and the requirements of the stakeholders taking\ndecisions on the basis of this information.\n(vi) So far, the MultiRISK Platform has been developed without in-\ntensive stakeholder interaction. The major reasons were, ﬁrst,\nthe objective to approach the challenge to develop a multiha-\nzard analysis scheme and implement it into a software from a\nscientiﬁc point of view, to identify general challenges and to\nnot only provide practical solutions to one speciﬁc problem.\nSecond, to develop a beta version that offers a basis for discus-\nsions with stakeholders and prevents from abstract design pro-\ncesses.

So\nfar, the performance of hazard and risk analyses is often out-\nsourced to consultants since technical know how and person-\nnel\nsituation\ndo\nnot\npermit\nthe\nrealization\nwithin\nthe\nadministrative units. However, this involves the danger of\nlow transparency of and little information on the modeling\nprocedure and does not offer the option to ﬂexibly compute\nscenarios, update the analyses etc. The performance of multi-\nhazard risk analyses by means of a speciﬁc software tool –\nwhich has to be adapted to the speciﬁc requirements, legisla-\ntion, and other user-speciﬁc needs – would accelerate and sim-\nplify the procedure and make the results more transparent.\nNevertheless, at least the ﬁrst parameterization and adaptation\nto the speciﬁc area and user needs will in most cases require\nexpert support from outside, the tool itself could stay in the\nhand of, e.g., the municipalities and offer ﬂexible and fast re-\nrunning. How realistic the introduction of such a tool in admin-\nistrative bodies and institutions is depends on the legislation,\nthe duties of the administrative units, and many more aspects.\nAn interesting example offers HAZUS, elaborated by and freely\navailable from FEMA (U.S. Federal Emergency Management\nAgency). With a variety of videos and manuals as well as\nHAZUS training courses, FEMA provides support with the\ntool. Moreover, HAZUS is delivered together with a nationwide\ndatabase offering sufﬁcient information to carry out a ﬁrst\noverview analysis of any region in the U.S.\nTransferring this approach to the Alpine context, a tool adjust-\ned to the necessity to ﬁrst, perform a susceptibility analysis at a\nscale 1:10,000–1:50,000, and second, to elaborate a hazard\nzoning map could be adjusted to the local conditions and cali-\nbrated in ﬁrst place by external (consultants) or national gov-\nernmental experts. The model itself, not only the results,\nremains with the respective administrative units, offering this\nway an update by consultants, governmental experts, or,\naccording to the respective experience and expertise, by the\ntechnicians of this unit.
