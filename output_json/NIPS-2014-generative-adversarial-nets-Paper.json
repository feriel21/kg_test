These striking successes have\nprimarily been based on the backpropagation and dropout algorithms, using piecewise linear units\n[17, 8, 9] which have a particularly well-behaved gradient . Deep generative models have had less\nof an impact, due to the difﬁculty of approximating many intractable probabilistic computations that\narise in maximum likelihood estimation and related strategies, and due to difﬁculty of leveraging\nthe beneﬁts of piecewise linear units in the generative context.

In predictability minimization, each hidden unit\nin a neural network is trained to be different from the output of a second network, which predicts\nthe value of that hidden unit given the value of all of the other hidden units. This work differs from\npredictability minimization in three important ways: 1) in this work, the competition between the\nnetworks is the sole training criterion, and is sufﬁcient on its own to train the network. Predictability\nminimization is only a regularizer that encourages the hidden units of a neural network to be sta-\ntistically independent while they accomplish some other task; it is not a primary training criterion.\n2) The nature of the competition is different.

The disadvantages are primarily that there is no explicit representation of pg(x), and that D\nmust be synchronized well with G during training (in particular, G must not be trained too much\nwithout updating D, in order to avoid “the Helvetica scenario” in which G collapses too many values\nof z to the same value of x to have enough diversity to model pdata), much as the negative chains of a\nBoltzmann machine must be kept up to date between learning steps. The advantages are that Markov\nchains are never needed, only backprop is used to obtain gradients, no inference is needed during\nlearning, and a wide variety of functions can be incorporated into the model.

One can approximately model all conditionals p(xS | x̸S) where S is a subset of the indices\nof x by training a family of conditional models that share parameters. Essentially, one can use\nadversarial nets to implement a stochastic extension of the deterministic MP-DBM [10].\n4. Semi-supervised learning: features from the discriminator or inference net could improve perfor-\nmance of classiﬁers when limited labeled data is available.\n5.
