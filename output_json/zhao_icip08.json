        "text": "The objective evaluation of the similarity of two images is of\ngreat interest for a variety of applications, including image\nquality evaluation, compression, and retrieval. The focus of\nthis paper is on texture similarity for content-based retrieval.\nIn contrast to traditional compression applications, texture re-\ntrieval is especially challenging because it allows substantial\npoint-by-point variations in textures that humans judge to be\nessentially identical. The goal of this paper is to develop tex-\nture similarity metrics that agree with human perception.\nMost existing image similarity metrics compare two im-\nages on a point-by-point basis. This includes both image do-\nmain metrics, such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and\na variety of metrics that incorporate a multiscale frequency\ndecomposition, such as DCT, subband, and DWT based met-\nrics [1]. The latter can incorporate low-level models of the\nHVS. On the other hand, structural similarity metrics (SSIM)\n[2] attempt to extract “structural” information from the im-\nages. The intent is to allow substantial point-by-point changes\nthat do not affect image structure, such as intensity and con-\ntrast changes, while remaining sensitive to changes that erode\nstructure, such as blurring and ringing.\nSSIM and its derivatives have been shown to perform well\nfor a variety of distortions, including additive white noise,\nblurring, compression artifacts, contract and intensity shifts,\nrotations, translations, and zoom [2]. In [3] the performance\nof SSIM metrics was examined in the context of realistic dis-\ntortions that arise in video coding and transmission applica-",

We show that the ability of both traditional and\nSSIM metrics to predict perceived similarity of texture image\npatches is not as satisfactory. We propose new SSIM metrics\nthat take advantage of the most powerful aspects of the SSIM\napproach and improve on its most serious limitations. Exper-\nimental results with a carefully selected set of 39 texture pairs\nand comparisons with informal subjective test results indicate\nthat the metric modiﬁcations lead to signiﬁcant performance\nimprovements. Indeed, we expect that the new metrics will\nhelp in the design of new generation texture retrieval tech-\nniques. While our focus is on texture, we believe that the new\nmetrics will apply equally well to general images.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2\nreviews SSIMs. Section 3 proposes new metrics for texture\nsimilarity. Section 4 analyzes the experimental results. The\nconclusions are summarized in Section 5.",

As we saw above, our goal is to\ntake advantage of the most powerful aspects of existing SSIM\nmetrics and to improve on their most serious limitations.\nOne of the most powerful ideas behind the SSIM approach\nto image quality is the fact that it moves away from point-by-\npoint comparisons that characterize traditional metrics, and\ninstead, bases the comparisons on region statistics. The hope\nis that as long as the region statistics are the same, the images,\nand in particular the textures, will look the same even though\nthere may be substantial point-by-point variations. However,\nthe original SSIM does not fully embrace this new philoso-\nphy, as the structure term – the one that actually gives the\nmetric its name – is in fact a point-by-point comparison. Al-\nthough the structure term can capture some of the shape dif-\nferences between the two images, it is too constrained to cap-\nture the perceptual similarity of two textures. Thus, we pro-\npose to eliminate the structure term and to replace it with ad-\nditional terms that depend on region statistics.\nOur motivation comes from the texture analysis/synthesis\nliterature. In [7], large texture patches are constructed from\nsmall texture patches in a visually seamless fashion without\neven reference to an original texture. It is thus very unlikely\nthat this extrapolated texture will match the original texture\non a point-by-point basis. Thus, in order to allow signiﬁcant\npoint-by-pointvariations in the proposed new metrics, we will\ndrop the structure term. However, as we will see in Section 4,\nthe luminance and contrast terms are not enough to ensure\nthe visual/structural similarity of the textures, so we will then\nadd more terms that depend on region statistics. Portilla and\nSimoncelli [8] demonstrated that a wide variety of textures\ncan be synthesized using a large set of statistical parameters\nthat characterize the coefﬁcients of a multiscale frequency de-\ncomposition.

Although direction is\naccounted for implicitly when we compute statistics of sub-\nbands with different orientations, we propose adding the ﬁrst\norder autocovariance in the horizontal, vertical, and two diag-\nonal directions.
