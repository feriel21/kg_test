In this method, a single reflecting point on an \n(assumed) horizontal reflector is imaged from several \ndifferent offsets between sources and receivers (Fig. 1). \nIn the case of many overlying layers, ray tracing is \nusually used to estimate the actual travel paths \nfollowed, and, from observed two-way travel times, \ninformation concerning 'average' velocities to the \nreflector can be inferred.

If we have done our \ncorrections well, the desired (primary) reflections from \nthe interface will add in phase and other events, \ncoherent or incoherent will tend to sum out of phase \nand so be eliminated in this 'stacking' process. \nAt this point we may try to remove the 'blurring' \neffect of the actual source wavelet by attempting to \n\"deconvolve' it from the trace to produce a perfect \nimpulse response. We are limited in these efforts by \nimperfect knowledge of this wavelet and by the fact \nthat seismic data is severely band-limited,'having lost \nboth low and high frequencies. \nif we now place the processed trace for each \nreflecting point side-by-side at the surface position of \nthis common mid point (the coincident source- \nreceiver Iocation), an image will appear from the \nalignment of reflection events from contiguous re- \nflectors forming a kind of image of the subsurface with \ntwo-way time in place of the depth variable. \nThe image will, in general, be distorted due to the \noriginal assumption of a horizontal reflector, which is \nnot usually met in practice. This assumption led us to \nincorrectly place the reflecting point beneath the \ncommon mid point (CMP) location. \nWe may correct the data for this error by performing \nan additional (image) processing step which 'migrates' \nthe reflection (approximately) to its correct location \nwithin the section. \nThe resulting display showing the approximate \nconfiguration of reflecting horizons within the Earth as \nwell as information (including velocities) obtained \nfrom the original data set shall become the focal point \nof our attention in an attempt to identify the kind of \ninformation we seek (Section I). \nThe interested reader is referred to Robinson and \nTreitel, TM Sheriff ~3~ and Wood and Treitel ~4~ for further \ndiscussion of the topics in this section.",

In \ncarrying out an interpretation based on reflection \ngeometry, as we have described here, it is important to \npresent the interpreter with several capabilities which \nenhance his ability to properly interpret the selected \nfacies. \nFirst it is important to have a sharp, clean display of \nthe geometric (structural) information revealed in the \nseismic section. Figure 2 shows a portion of a seismic \nsection, as it might appear on our image analysis \nsystem, representing an image of the subsurface which \nhas been constructed as explained previously. One \nalternative form of display, for example, would be to \nimage zero crossings as shown in Fig. 3. The data \nshould not be contaminated heavily by noise in order \nto use this procedure. A second alternative which turns \nout to be quite useful in this respect is a phase display. \nThis type of display will be discussed later. We may \nthen apply various procedures such as smoothing and \nedge detectors to the data in order to enhance \ncontinuity of reflections or to highlight discontinuities \nwhich may result from faulting or other terminations \nof the reflector. \nAnother useful procedure is to be able to 'flatten' (or \notherwise distort) a given reflecting horizon which has \nbeen identified such as an erosional surface (un-",

A river channel which is sand-filled \nand subsequently buried by clays may take the form \n(due to differential compaction) shown in Fig. 4a. \nFlattening on the upper horizon clearly reveals the \noriginal structure of the river channel as shown in Fig. \n4b. \nFlattening on the lower horizon may indicate a \nmound such as a reef occurrance as shown in Fig. 4c. \nWe have to look further to identify the correct choice \nbetween these two possibilities. In the actual example \nillustrated the reef would b¢ ruled out because it would \nhave to have continued growing after the layer above it \n(which does not thin across the mound) had been \ndeposited--an unlikely scenario. \nFinally, we may apply certain pattern recognition \nalgorithms such as scale and translation invariant \npattern recognition, horizon tracking, and image \nprocessing to identify locations in the data where \npinchouts, faulting, etc. may have occurred. \nWe have given some indication of how we approach \nfacie analysis using reflection geometry and some of \nthe imaging/recognition tools which have been de- \nscribed in conjunction with an interactive imaging \nsystem.

Because of the enormity of this \nsubject, we shall discuss the use of many of these \nattributes only by way of example. \nStructural and stratigraphic expressions of several \ntypes of traps are shown in Fig. 5. \"°~ Figure 5A shows \nan anticline trap which is the type of trap associated \nwith the very first oil discovery and for some time was \nthought to be the only trapping mechanism for \npetroleum hydrocarbons. The existence of free gas in \nthis type of trap depends on the pressures present in the \nreservoir. At high pressures, the gas will go into \nsolution in the oil and at lower pressures will appear as \nshown. This type of trap is an example of structural \ntrap. In Fig. 5B is shown a salt dome which is formed \nby the plastic flow of buried salts which may be the \nresult of evaporation of an ancient sea bed. As the salt \nis buried and subjected to increasing pressure, it is \ncapable of plastic flow and can force its way up \nthrough the sedimentary overburden, pulling the beds \nup alongside its flanks. This upward dip, terminating \nagainst the impermeable salt, produces a potential \ntrapping mechanism and, indeed, this type of trap is \nvery common in the Gulf Coast region of the United \nStates. Many early traps which were found in this \nregion were of this type.",

Stratigraphic traps can be extremely subtle and \ndifficult to detect using seismic methods but they are \nbecoming more and more important as the more easily \ndetected structural traps which have not been found \nbecame fewer in number. In Fig. 5D, a reef trap is \nshown, which is important in many pools found in \nNorth America, including Texas and New Mexico, \nMichigan, and Western Canada, for example. These \nreefs frequently still contain porous material and often \nare associated with source rocks, such as bituminous \nshales, surrounding them. \nIn Fig. 5E another common type of trap is shown, \nknown as the fault trap, which is produced as a result of \nfaulting in the Earth, which may bring an impermeable \nsediment into contact with a porous and permeable \none as shown in the illustration. The oil migrates \nthrough the permeable layer until it encounters the \nimpermeable material into which it cannot flow, and \nso a trap is formed. Finally, in Fig. 5F, we see an \nexample of a hydrologic trap in which water pressure \ndue to surface waters entering folded strata at both \nends holds the oil in place due to the pressure of the \nformation waters. An example of this type of trap \nwould be the San Juan Basin in New Mexico.",

We might point out that \nsudden and easily detected phase changes can occur \nwith the onset of each new reflection event so that the \nphase display tends to resemble an image enhanced \nsection. \nFrequency, either instantaneous or weighted can be \na useful indicator of absorption where this is signifi- \ncant enough to be observed. The major example of this \nwould be as a direct hydrocarbon indicator. Gas \ncharged reservoirs are known to be strongly attenuat- \ning to high frequencies in the seismic signal. These \nreservoirs often exhibit characteristic low frequency",
