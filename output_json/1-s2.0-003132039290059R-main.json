Seismic image segmentation rules are \nderived from examples by using minimum entropy rule learning techniques. Two new methods are presented \nfor using geometric proximity to reference points in region growing. The first one is based on Voronoi \ntessellation and mathematical morphology.

The texture properties of a seismic \nimage will be used to partition an image into regions \nwhich are characterized by a property consistent with \nthe stratigraphic information and are contrasted to \ntheir adjacent regions. This means that the primitive \nfeatures used in the segmentation must be such that \nthey have correspondence with the entities used by the \ninterpreter. A feature which is already available with \nthe seismic data, is the reflection strength which is \nessentially the intensity of the seismic image. Seismic \nimage transformations can also be used in texture \nanalysis, t~6) Such a transform traditionally used in \nstratigraphic interpretation is the Hiibert transform. It \nproduces additional texture features (instantaneous \namplitude, phase, frequency).

Such rules are very difficult to evaluate in \nseismic applications, because there exists no straight- \nforward relation between the features and the seismic \nimage regions that have some geophysical significance. \nIt is very desirable to construct a system that can infer \nthe rule from examples given by the interpreter. There- \nfore, we propose the following approach. Image regions, \nwhich are representative of the different types of \nseismic textures, are chosen by the interpreter. These \nregions and the corresponding sets of feature vectors \nconstitute the examples of the interpretation task. \nThe appropriate seismic texture discrimination rule is \ncreated by using rule learning techniques based on the \nminimal entropy principle. The system has the ability \nto reject features possessing no discriminatory power. \nThe rules derived by this system are able to dis- \ncriminate, for example, regions having long and strong \nhorizons from regions having short and weak horizons, \nor tilted regions from regions having approximately \nhorizontal horizons. Thus, the derived rule predicates \nare of the form \"feature value less than or equal to a \nproper threshold\". The derived rule consists of dis- \njunctions of conjunctions of predicates. Thus, the \nsegmentation rule splits the feature space into hyper- \ncubes. Each hypercube describes one seismic texture \nclass. We have chosen this type of texture discrimina- \ntion rule, because it has close resemblance with the \nintuitive rules used by the human interpreter. There- \nfore, the interpreter can easily check the geophysical \nsignificance of the derived rule. Other types of rules \n(e.g. using discriminant surfaces (~7)) cannot be easily",

All other \npixels can be assigned to seismic image regions by \nusing the geometric proximity to the already seg- \nmented seismic horizons/runs. The image domain is \npartitioned into regions such that all points in the same \nregion have reference points of a specific texture class \nas their nearest neighbours. Such a segmentation \ncorresponds to a generalized Voronoi tessellation of \nthe image domain and is obtained by using mathe- \nmatical morphology techniques. A second segmenta- \ntion method is also proposed for this case. It uses the \nassumption that the already classified pixels \"radiate\" \nat different frequencies. The unclassified pixels are \nassigned to the texture class sending the maximal \nradiation energy. \nThe outline of the paper is as follows. Feature \nextraction is described in Section 2.

If parts \nof the binary signals overlap, the binary output has \nvalue one for all the duration of the overlapping, \notherwise this operator performs as an AND operator. \nThe difference between the classical and the generalized \ndefinition of the runs is illustrated in Fig. 4. Figure 4(a) \nshows three adjacent binary traces. Obviously all ones \nbelong to the same event. The classical and the \ngeneralized definitions of the run give the results \nshown in Figs 4(b) and (c), respectively. The generalized \nrun identifies the region of ones as a single entity \nhaving run length 3, whereas the classical definition \nfails to do so. The run-length image Rj[/] can be \nconstructed by using the operator • as follows. It \nconsists of columns R~ of the form",

(26~ Specifically, it has been proposed the \noptimal choice of thresholds (used in predicates) and \nthe optimal choice of rules having the form of disjunc- \ntions of conjunctions of predicates from examples and \ncounterexamples, by minimizing an entropy function. \nThe example and counterexample set is given by the \ninterpreter. Therefore, such a system can learn rules \nfrom examples and it is based on an optimality \ncriterion. First of all, the case of the discrimination of \ntwo different classes will be treated, in order to simplify \nthe presentation. A modification of this scheme capable \nof implementing a multiclass rule learning will be \ndescribed afterwards. Simultaneous optimization for \nthe thresholds and the rule structure is very difficult. \nTherefore, the optimization is split in two suboptimal \nsteps:",

Each leaf corresponds to a class and to \na recognition rule for this class. The rule which \ndiscriminates a class at a certain level is calculated as \nfollows. One of the unclassified example sets, e.g. Qk, \nis considered to be the candidate for discrimination. \nThe union f2' of the rest of the unclassified example \nsets is considered to be the counterexample set. Thus, \nthe problem is reduced to a two-class classification \nproblem at each level. The classification rule is obtained \nby the techniques described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. The \nderived rule L k discriminates the class Ck against the \nrest of the unclassified classes. This rule has the \nfollowing probability of misclassification:",

We have \nto infer what information can be assigned to other \npixels that do not participate in horizons, assuming \nthat pixels close to horizons will behave similarly. \nThus, we have to investigate for proximity rather than \nfor similarity. We will propose two methods for solving \nthe problem under consideration. The first one is based \non a modification of the Voronoi tessellation ~2s) and \nthe mathematical morphology, t291 while the second \nmethod is based on a \"radiation model\". The horizon \npixeis are used as \"seeds\" for the Voronoi tessellation \nof the seismic image. The Voronoi tessellation of a \nplane (in our case the image plane) results in a partition \ninto regions, such that all points in the same subset \nhave as their nearest neighbours reference points of a \nspecific texture class and are classified according to \nthem. The horizon pixels grow in successive steps until \nthey cover the entire image. At each step it is checked \nif regions stemming from horizons of the same cluster \nhave a common boundary. If this is the case, these \nregions are merged. The boundary (if any) between two \ndifferent clusters is \"frozen\" at each step. The growing \nof the image regions is performed by conditional \ndilation, t29~ Let Xk, k= 1,...,K be subsets of the \nimage domain X, representing the image pixels which \ncorrespond to each texture region. Let also X~(i), \nk = 1,..., K be the sets representing regions k = 1,..., K \nat step (i) of the growing procedure. At step (0), Xk(O) \ncontains the horizon pixels corresponding to class k. \nThe region growing which leads to a modified Voronoi \ntessellation of the image plane is based on mathe- \nmatical morphology. Let also B be a structuring \nelement, ~29'3°) whose size determines the size of the \nregion growing at each step. Its shape governs the \ngeometry of cluster growing. If uniform growing along \nall dimensions is required, the structuring element B \nmust be a disk. However, in the Euclidean grid ~2 no \nexact representation of a disk can be found. Thus, the \nstructuring element CIRCLE shown in Fig. 5 has been \nused instead. This produces an acceptable relatively \nuniform growing along all dimensions.

The main disadvantage of this approach is \nthat it does not eliminate small patches corresponding \nto noise, which may be found inside much larger \nregions. Its advantage is that only a few recursions are \nrequired for the segmentation of the entire image. \nAnother approach more robust to \"noise\" will be \ndescribed subsequently. It uses the so-called \"radiation \nmodel\". Similar models have already been used in \npattern recognition (e.g. the potential functions in the \ndeterministic approach to trainable pattern classi- \nfiers(lye). The proposed scheme is based on the follow- \ning fictitious experiment. Let us suppose that a horizon \npixel radiates according to the law 1/r. This means that \nthe radiation received at a pixel (i,j) is inversely \nproportional to the distance of this pixel from the \nradiating horizon pixel. If each horizon pixel radiates \nat a different \"frequency\", according to the class it \nbelongs to, each pixel receives sums of radiations at \ndifferent frequencies. The pixel (i,j) is assigned to the \nclass from which it receives the maximal total radiation \nenergy. By implementing this approach, small regions \ndisappear if they lie inside larger regions because they \nradiate less. The radiation pattern can be described in \nterms of a function of the form",

        "text": "Before describing the details of the application of the \nproposed method for seismic image segmentation, we \nwould like to give some details on the use of the various \nimage features. The reflection strength is originally a \nreal number. However, it is scaled in the range [0... 255] \nso that it becomes positive and can be displayed as \nseismic image intensity on display devices. The mean \nhorizon strength has also the same range. The horizon \nlength is an integer and it gives the number of traces \nwhich participate in the horizon. The run length is also \nan integer indicating the number of traces that parti- \ncipate in the run. Finally, the local and global horizon \nslopes are measured in degrees. \nThe developed techniques for seismic image seg- \nmentation have been applied successfully in a variety \nof seismic images. In the following, the segmentation \nof the seismic image shown in Fig. 6(a) will be des- \ncribed. The horizons, which have been followed by \nthe technique described in Section 2, are shown in \nFig. 6(b). All local and global horizon features can be \neasily calculated. The magnitude of the Hilbert trans- \nform is shown in Fig. 6(c). The run length image is \nshown in Fig. 6(d). Four representative seismic image \nregions having different seismic texture are chosen by \nthe interpreter and are shown in Fig. 7. These image \nregions are denoted by R1,R2,R3,R4. \nThe corres- \nponding feature classes are denoted by C~, i = 1 ..... 4. \nThe feature vectors corresponding to the pixels in these \nregions consist of the example sets of the learning pro- \ncedure. The differences between the features in the \ntraining regions can be found by visual inspection of \nFigs 6(b)-(d) and/or by comparing the feature histo- \ngrams that are calculated in the training regions. By \nvisual inspection of Figs 6(b) and 7, the following \nqualitative observations can be made:",
