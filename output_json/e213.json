        "text": "K. Campbell (2010) questions our data presented in Figueiredo et \nal., (2009) and proposes a late Pliocene (ca. 2.5 Ma) origin for the Ama-\nzon River. Here, we provide some clariﬁ cations and show that a late Mio-\ncene origin of the Amazon River is underpinned by a very robust data set. \nFirstly, Campbell comments that the absolute ages of the base and top of \nbiozone NN9 differ from Lourens et al. (2004). The presented biostrati-\ngraphic zonation is based on information from Petrobras’ data bank, and \nthis in-house nannofossil biozonation scheme is somewhat different from \nthe International zonation. Based on Lourens et al. (2004) and Rafﬁ  et al. \n(2006), the absolute age of Amazon River onset changes to 10.5 Ma, far \nfrom the 2.5 Ma proposed by Campbell’s model.\nSecondly, the Purus Arch originated as a NNW-SSE–trending gra-\nben, and inverted to a high during the Proterozoic (Brito Neves, 2002). \nThroughout the Phanerozoic, this structural feature alternatingly separat-\ned—or connected—the Solimões (western Amazonia) and Amazonas ba-\nsins (eastern Amazonia) (Cunha et al., 2007; Wanderley Filho et al., 2007). \nThe Solimões Formation—of Miocene age (Hoorn, 1993, and references \ntherein)—is restricted to western Amazonia, therefore a reactivation of \nthe Purus Arch must have happened during this time. Causal mechanism \nfor this reactivation is ascribed to the Quechua I tectonic event which is \ncoincident in age with deposition of the Solimões Formation (Noble et al., \n1990, and references therein).\nThirdly, Campbell wrongly cites Lourens et al. (2004) who did not \nsay “… sea level had reached nearly modern levels by the beginning of \nNN9” as stated in Campbell’s Comment. Instead they said “Sea level grad-\nually started to fall after 15 Ma, culminating in a dramatic drop around \n10.5 Ma…” (p. 425), an age that coincides with the base of the biozone \nNN9 (Lourens et al., 2004; Rafﬁ  et al., 2006), and therefore supports our \ninterpretation. More important, however, is the Petrobras’ extensive data \nbank of seismic data and wells that attest that the early Tortonian sea level \nfell beyond the contemporary shelf edge over the entire Brazilian shore-\nline, giving support to the interpretation presented in our article.\nFourthly, Campbell’s claim that there is poor correlation between ter-\nrigenous mass accumulation rates (TMAR) of the Amazon Fan and the \nCeará Rise is unfounded. Distinct changes in TMAR and geochemical \nsignals from 10 Ma onward are reported from the Ceará Rise (King et al., \n1997; Dobson et al., 2001). King et al. (1997) remark on an overall in-\ncrease of TMAR from the late Miocene onward with a particularly strong \nincrease at 5.1 Ma. In addition, Dobson et al. (2001) specify that prior \nto 10 Ma deposition, sedimentation at the Ceará Rise was dominated by \nArchaean-sourced shales, whereas post-Archean shales (i.e., of Andean \norigin) are deposited from 10 and 9 Ma onward, with a vast increase dur-\ning the Pliocene. This coincides well with the geochemical changes and \nvariations in sedimentation rates as described in Figueiredo et al., (2009).\nFinally, Campbell suggests there is no overlap between our geochemi-\ncal analysis and that of Basu et al. (1990) or McDaniel et al. (1997). The \ndepleted-mantle average Nd model age (TDM) of 1.46 Ga that Basu et al. \n(1990) found for the ﬂ uvial sands from the Madre de Dios basin does not",

To deﬁ ne the sedimentary prove-\nnance for the Amazon Fan we used McDaniel et al. (1997) as a benchmark, \nsince they show results from a well-known Andean-sourced succession, \nwhich is similar to those from Well 1 presented in our article. In fact, as \npointed out very well in Campbell’s Comment, our TDM mean age (1.591 \nGa) is lower than the McDaniel et al. (1997) age (1.688 Ga). It favors our \ninterpretation since it reﬂ ects a higher contribution from younger cratonic \nsources located in the westernmost Amazonia. In spite of this, we do thank \nCampbell for pointing out that the label of the axes in our Appendix 5b \nwere inverted. The corrected version of Appendix 5 has been posted online.\nIn conclusion, all data we presented support our hypothesis for a \nlate Miocene onset of the transcontinental Amazon River, and show that \nCampbell’s model for the late Pliocene initiation of the Amazon River \nis ﬂ awed.",
