Following the initial hypotheses of the theory, we provide an\nalternative expression of the exact solution for a noncohesive wedge, better suited to slope instabilities. Our\nformulation allows a direct calculation of the ﬂuid pressure required for the system to deform and predicts two\nkinds of gravitational deformation: shallow slumping and/or deep gravitational spreading rooting on the basal\ndetachment. To verify the predictions of the model, we performed scaled experiments with pore pressure under\nconditions close to the critical taper hypotheses. The good agreement between our experimental results and\nthe theory conﬁrms the applicability of the critical taper model to the formation of gravitational structures in\nsedimentary wedges subjected to pore ﬂuid pressure.",

        "text": "The understanding of the evolution of deformation is a key issue in analyzing geological processes, such as\norogenic episodes or the triggering of gravitational instabilities. In a series of inﬂuential papers dealing with\nanalyses of the mechanics of fold and thrust belts and accretionary prisms, Davis et al. [1983], Dahlen et al.\n[1984], and Dahlen [1984, 1990] showed that the mechanical and structural evolution of wedge-shaped masses\ndeforming above a detachment plane could be described by the critical Coulomb wedge theory. Davis et al.\n[1983] compared the evolution of a submarine accretionary wedge to that of a pile of sand in front of a moving\nbulldozer. The wedge steepens until the critical taper is attained, i.e., the angle between the base and the\nsurface of the wedge reaches a critical value. When the critical taper is attained, the wedge is considered to be\nstable: Deformation is restricted to sliding along the detachment plane. Dahlen [1984] provided an exact gen-\neral solution to the problem of the critical taper of noncohesive wedges. His formulation has multiple solutions,\ndepending on the shear orientation on the basal detachment and the state of stress (i.e., compressive or\nextensional, respectively) within the wedge (Figure 1).",

This critical taper solution describes the deformation of a wedge-shaped\ncrust overlying a low-angle normal fault. Therefore, “extensional wedges” are found in active extensional set-\ntings. However, extensional states of stress are not restricted to such regime. Effectively, in the absence of any\ncompressive or extensional force, the shear stress at the base is oriented toward the outer edge of the wedge\n(Figure 1). In that case, the critical taper corresponds to the maximal surface slope sustainable by the wedge\nbefore it slides under its own weight.

Nevertheless, these authors limited their analyses to the\ncompressive edge and did not carry out further investigations on the extensional upslope part of the system.\nMoreover, submarine slope instabilities are generally studied at a local scale, using simpliﬁed 1-D inﬁnite slope\nanalysis [Mello and Pratson, 1999], 2-D slices method [Bishop, 1955; Lambe and Whitman, 1969], two-wedge\nmodels [Lambe and Whitman, 1969; Nadim et al., 2003; Leynaud et al., 2004], or numerical simulations [Hutton and\nSyvitski, 2004]. Kukowski et al. [2010] also investigated the stability of slopes along the Hikurangi margin of New\nZealand using a critical taper analysis. Nonetheless, the applicability of the critical Coulomb wedge theory to the\ncase of gravity-driven extension has not yet been supported by further experimental or numerical studies. To our\nknowledge, only Morgan and McGovern [2005] compared the critical taper solution in the extensional part of a\nvolcanic system subjected to gravitational collapse with numerical simulations (discrete element method).\nHowever, their analysis did not take into account the role of pore ﬂuid pressure on deformation.",

The models were built on\na 60 cm long and 40 cm large sieve and comprised a 0.5 cm thick basal low-permeability glass microbeads layer\noverlain by a coarse sand cover (thickness H, Figure 5a). The downslope edge of the cover had the shape of a\ntriangular wedge. The surface slope of this wedge varied between 8° and 20°, depending on the series of\nexperiments. We used materials having a negligible cohesion [Schellart, 2000], corresponding to the assumptions\nof the analytical model. The high permeability contrast between the glass microbeads and the sand (Table 1)\nallowed for ﬂuid overpressure on the detachment surface (Figure 5a) [Mourgues and Cobbold, 2006a, 2006b].\nFluid pressure in the reservoir was monitored during the experiments using a U-manometer. We controlled the\ndistribution of the coefﬁcient of ﬂuid pressure on the detachment surface by adjusting the dip of the sieve under\nthe downslope edge (Figure 5a). Indeed, for λ*\nb to be constant along the detachment surface, the air pressure loss\nwithin the triangular edge of the model (Figure 5b) had to be balanced by adding glass microbeads underneath\n(thickness H′, Figure 5a) [Mourgues and Cobbold, 2006a, 2006b; Mourgues et al., 2009]. Figure 5c shows calcula-\ntions of the basal ﬂuid overpressure ratio for various values of the ratio H′/H. Though ﬂuid overpressure was not\nstrictly constant (λ*\nb = 0.23± 0.04 in the case illustrated in Figures 5b and 5c), a value of 0.75 of the ratio H′/H\nallowed us to minimize variations in λ*\nb (Figure 5c) along the detachment surface.",

It does not allow analyses of further motion (i.e., sliding along the ﬁrst formed fault and/or\npropagation of normal faults) that may depend on the evolution of ﬂuid overpressure along the decollement. In\nnatural systems, once the landslide process is initiated, ﬂuid overpressure along the basal decollement may be\nreduced because of the ﬂuid circulation along faults rooting into the detachment layer. Such a behavior is not\npredicted by the analytical model described above and cannot be experimentally simulated. Indeed, though\nthe use of compressed air in our experiments allows for the reproducing of ﬂuid overpressure distribution\nwithin the wedge, the ﬂuid ﬂows are not scaled (see discussion in Mourgues and Cobbold [2006b]). Experiments\ninvolving a more viscous ﬂuid and less permeable materials would be necessary to investigate the further\nevolution of the slide and fault dynamics.",
