Furthermore, the lobe-shaped\ndeposits display a very specific morphology with high parallel lateral levees. A numerical\nmodel based on Saint Venant equations and the empirical variable friction coefficient\nproposed by Pouliquen and Forterre (2002) is used to simulate unconfined granular flow\nover an inclined plane with a constant supply. Numerical simulations successfully\nreproduce the self-channeling of the granular lobe and the levee-channel morphology in\nthe deposits without having to take into account mixture concepts or polydispersity.\nNumerical simulations suggest that the quasi-static shoulders bordering the flow are\ncreated behind the front of the granular material by the rotation of the velocity field due to\nthe balance between gravity, the two-dimensional pressure gradient, and friction. For a\nsimplified hydrostatic model, competition between the decreasing friction coefficient and\nincreasing surface gradient as the thickness decreases seems to play a key role in the\ndynamics of unconfined flows. The description of the other disregarded components of the\nstress tensor would be expected to change the balance of forces. The front’s shape appears\nto be constant during propagation. The width of the flowing channel and the velocity of\nthe material within it are almost steady and uniform. Numerical results suggest that\nmeasurement of the width and thickness of the central channel morphology in deposits in\nthe field provides an estimate of the velocity and thickness during emplacement.",

The channeling and the\nformation of levees are strongly related to the free lateral\nboundaries and to the highly unsteady stopping stage.\nHowever, while the steady laterally uniform flow regime\nof confined granular materials along inclined planes has\nbeen largely characterized [Gray et al., 1999; Pouliquen,\n1999], the behavior of granular materials under unsteady\nand nonuniform conditions is still an open question. The\nexperiments of Fe´lix and Thomas [2004] on unconfined dry\ngranular flows over an inclined plane show that the forma-\ntion of levees results from the combination of lateral static\nzones on each border of the flow (shoulders) and the\ndrainage of the central part of the flow after the supply\nstops. Particle segregation features are also created during\nthe flow, corresponding to those observed in the deposits of\npyroclastic flows. When the range of sizes of the polydis-\nperse material is reduced, the morphology is smoothed but\nnever reaches a flat surface [Fe´lix and Thomas, 2004].\nHowever, a perfectly monodispersed material could not be\nused in experimental work, and it is therefore possible that\npolydispersity is a necessary condition for the formation of\nthe levee-channel morphology. Moreover, it is uncertain\nwhether this morphology can be obtained without assuming\nBingham rheology, for example using a Coulomb friction\nlaw, better suited to describing the flow of dry granular\nmatter [see, e.g., Hutter et al., 1995]. It is also unknown\nhow the shoulders channeling the flow are created and if the\nassociated spatial nonuniformity is linked to the hysteretic\ncharacter of the granular material, i.e., its capacity to be\neither in a static or flowing state depending on the history of\nthe dynamics.",

Continuum models are\nexpressed in terms of the change of the vertically averaged\nvelocity field and of the associated vertical length scale h, i.e.,\nthe avalanche thickness, and describe hydrostatic imbalance\n[Mangeney-Castelnau et al., 2003] or nonhydrostatic plas-\nticity and friction effects [Savage and Hutter, 1989]. The\nmodels assume an averaged friction dissipation described\nphenomenologically by Coulomb0s friction law with a\nconstant [e.g., Hutter et al., 1995; Naaim et al., 1997] or\nvelocity- and thickness-dependent [Pouliquen, 1999;\nDouady et al., 1999] friction coefficient. More sophisticated\nmodels have been recently proposed by Denlinger and\nIverson [2004] based on Mohr-Coulomb plasticity theory.\nAlthough the friction law describing the behavior of steady\nflows has been relatively well refined by laboratory experi-\nments, the behavior of a granular mass at small Froude\nnumbers (i.e., at low velocities) is still an open question.\nHysteresis is an important characteristic of granular slope\nstability. Indeed, a granular slope starts to flow when its\ninclination reaches a typical avalanche angle qa and comes\nto rest once its slope reaches another so-called repose angle\nqr < qa. The hysteretic behavior occurs for inclination angles\nq 2[qr, qa] [e.g., Pouliquen and Forterre, 2002; Daerr and\nDouady, 1999]. The metastability of a granular slope in this\nrange of angles has been shown to be very complex and\nrequires a biphasic description of strong and weak contact\nnetworks in the granular pile [Deboeuf et al., 2005a,\n2005b]. In the macroscopic depth-averaged formulation\ninherent to the long-wave approximation, the empiric\ndescription of this metastability remains uncertain. Still,\nthe formation of channeling flows with the construction of\nnearly static shoulders as well as the existence of levees\nare likely to be strongly related to the behavior of granular\nmaterials near the stopping or destabilization phases. Because\nunconfined flows continuously juggle between static and\nflowing conditions, their numerical simulation can be used\nto improve the macroscopic description of the metastable\nbehavior of granular flows which is still an open question.",

Indeed, to satisfy the hydrostatic\nassumption for shallow flow over inclined topography, it is\nthe acceleration normal to the topography that must be\nneglected compared to the gradient of the pressure normal\nto the topography. The reference frame is shown in Figure 1.\nThe 2-D horizontal coordinate vector is x = (x, y) 2 R2 and\nthe topography is described by the scalar function b(x, y)\nwith a 3-D unit upward normal vector",

Steady uniform flows over\nrough bedrock have been observed experimentally for a range\nof inclination angles, making it possible to identify a scaling\nlaw relating the thickness and mean velocity of the flow\n[Pouliquen, 1999]. This scaling law or flow rule involves\ntwo empirical functions that are expected to contain funda-\nmental information on the friction properties of the material\nand of its interaction with the rough plane: (1) the function\nrelating the slope angle q of an inclined plane to the thickness\nstaying on the plane hstop(q) and (2) the function relating the\nslope angle q to the minimum thickness of an initially at rest\ngranular layer necessary to generate a flow on the same plane\nhstart(q).",

The white and magenta lines represent the dynamic\npath in the first experiment (Q1 = 2 \f 10\u00034 m2 s\u00031) and in the\nsecond experiment (Q2 = 4 \f 10\u00034 m2 s\u00031) respectively. In\nthe first experiment, the granular front reaches A1 at time\nt ’ 25 s corresponding in Figure 2 to the beginning of the\ndecrease of the Froude number at very small thicknesses.\nThen, the thickness increases with decreasing friction coef-\nficient and decreasing Froude number until the steady state\nregime is reached, corresponding to the top of the hatpin\nshape for h = h1 (white lines). The behavior of all the other\npoints in the uniform part of the flow (x > 80 cm) follow the\nsame path as point A1. In the second experiment (Q2 = 2Q1),\nthe path of point A1 is qualitatively the same and another\nsteady state h2 > h1, Fr2 > Fr1 is reached. The friction\ncoefficients m obtained in the steady uniform regime are\nactually exactly equal to m = tan q = 0.4663 in the first and\nsecond experiments as would be expected from equation (6).\nAs a result, the value of m in all steady uniform regimes,\nwhatever the input flux and the related steady thickness and\nvelocity, is equal to m = tan q = 0.4663 as would be expected\nfrom equation (6). This strongly supports the validity of the\nnumerical model used here. In regions where the flow is not\nuniform (i.e., near the front), equation (6) does not hold and\nthe friction coefficient changes because the friction force\nbalances the driving forces due to gravity and pressure\ngradients as shown in Figure 5.",

In this\nnumerical experiment, the thickness of the granular mass is\nalways lower than hstart (hstart/hstop = 1, 86) as was the case\nfor the same input flux in the case of confined flow studied\nin section 4. The maximum almost steady thickness of the\nflow at x = 1.2 m is hs1 = 1.03 hstop ’ hstop. In the\nexperiments, the flowing thickness is significantly higher\nthan hstop. This small calculated value of h may be\nexplained by the absence of downslope shear stresses tXY.\nFriction is expected to be significant in the shear zones\nbetween the flowing material and the almost static should-\ners; however, it is neglected in LWA models. The key role\nof sidewall friction on the flowing material for confined\nflows is well known and empirical relations based on\nexperimental results have been proposed to take it into\naccount [Roberts, 1965; Savage, 1979; Hutter and Koch,\n1991; Taberlet et al., 2003; Jop et al., 2005].

The\nthickness staying on the plane in the central channel hc =\n0.89 hstop is slightly smaller than hstop (Figure 7c), contrary\nto what was observed in the experiments of Fe´lix and\nThomas [2004] where hc ’ hstop. However, Dh = hstop \u0003\nhc ’ 3 \f 10\u00034 m < d, where d is the grain diameter. As was\ndiscussed in section 5.1, this numerical small thickness may\nbe due to the absence of lateral shear stresses in LWA\ncausing the expected strong dissipation between the flowing\nlayer and the quasi-static shoulders to be neglected. The\nthickness profiles as well as the downslope velocity profiles\nduring the draining phase have a steeper slope than the\nprofiles obtained for confined flows in section 4. This\nobservation should be related to the much smaller flux\nQf = hf uf = 6.5 \f 10\u00035 m2 s\u00031 involved here in the flowing\nchannel. The similar behaviors during the stopping phase of\nconfined and unconfined flow suggest that the shoulders\nbehaves almost like a wall during the draining phase. The\nvelocity of the stopping wave calculated from the results\npresented in Figure 11 is of the same order as the wave\nvelocity in shallow flows ~c and slightly increases with time\nas was observed for confined flow (see section 4). The\ndownslope oscillation observed numerically on the deposit\nof confined flows and shown in Figure 6 is not present in\nthe case of unconfined flow (Figure 11b). The presence of\nshoulders may add a degree of freedom in the system\ncompared to confining walls and then increase its ability\nto absorb shocks through the interaction between the\nshoulders and the stopping material. This interaction is\nclearly reflected in the deformation of the free surface at\nt = 153 s just after the supply is cut (Figure 12e).",

The flow creates\nits own channel by building lateral shoulders. With time,\nthese zones spread laterally although the spreading slows\nwith time. After t = 100 s, the flow structure is likely\nestablished. Once this state is reached, at any x, except near\nthe front, there is a quasi-stationary state. The downslope\nvelocity and thickness profiles are quasi-constant with time.\nOnly the very slow widening prevents the state from being\nreally stationary. The downslope velocity u is almost\nconstant in the central part of the flow, and drops to 0 when\nmoving transversally to the lateral borders (Figure 12). With\ntime, the decrease to 0 becomes sharper, distinguishing two\nregions: a region with quasi-uniform flow directed down-\nslope and a region of quasi-static lateral material slowly\nmigrating in the transverse direction with no downslope\ncomponent of the velocity. In Figures 12b–12f, the trans-\nverse velocity v is two orders of magnitude lower than the\ndownslope velocity u. The values of 100v are represented\nby dotted lines in Figure 12. The slow transverse velocity v\nobtained numerically at t = 100 s and t = 140 s at y > 0.16\nmust be studied in more detail in order to assess their\nphysical or numerical significance.",

The\npressure force is represented together with the difference\nbetween the friction force and the force of gravity. The\ninertial force is shown to be negligible in Figure 13 except\nat t = 37 s and t = 57 s where the deceleration @u/@t is\nsignificant because of the high resisting force ffx \u0003 fgx (gray\nline) compared to the driving pressure force fpx (black line).\nAs for confined flow, at leading order, in the x direction, the\nfriction force balances the force of gravity (ffx \u0003 fgx = 0)\nexcept at the front as shown in Figure 13a where the norm\nof the pressure force increases as does the difference\nbetween the friction force and the gravity force. Initially,\nthe resisting friction force (ffx \u0003 fgx) is higher than the driving\npressure force fpx as is the case at t = 37 s in Figure 13a at\nthe front. With time, the forces at the front balance each other\nin order for the flow to reach a steady state (Figure 13a). A\nsimilar balance is observed within the granular lobe when\nrepresenting the x component of the forces as a function of\nthe y direction (Figure 13b). While the dissipation force\nis higher than the pressure force within the granular lobe at\nt = 57 s, these forces almost balance each other at t = 60 s\n(Figure 13b) although the flow just at the lateral margins is\nnot perfectly solved numerically (see Tai et al. [2002] for\nmore sophisticated numerical treatment of the margins). In\nour simple model, the second-order balance between the\nchange of the friction force and the pressure force is shown\nto play a key role in the dynamics of the flow, making it\npossible to reach a steady state with nonuniform thickness.\nThis balance would certainly change if the disregarded\ncomponents of the stresses were accounted for.",

In the vicinity of\nthe front, at t = 57 s, the forces acting in the y direction are\nalmost zero so that the velocity is mainly directed downslope.\nFigure 13b shows that the x component of the pressure force\nfpx is almost constant transversally at t = 57 s. The force of\ngravity is obviously also constant in the x direction. On\nthe other hand, the friction is higher when approaching\nthe shoulders because of small thickness. As a result, the\ndownslope velocity u decreases when approaching\nthe lateral border of the lobe. Upward from the front\n(at t = 58 s in Figure 13b), but still in the front zone, the\nsame trend can be observed but the x pressure force fpx also\nincreases transversally because of the shape of the front.\nHowever, the effect of increasing friction overweighs the\ndriving effect of the pressure force and the balance of forces\nalso leads to a deceleration of the downslope velocity when\napproaching the borders. Obviously, the y component of the\nfriction force ffy also increases because of small thickness\nwhen approaching the borders (Figure 18). The y compo-\nnent of the gravity force fgy is equal to zero, inertia is\nnegligible and the driving force is only the pressure\nforce (black lines in Figure 18). As already observed in the\nx direction, the increase of dissipation due to friction\noverweighs the increase of driving effects due to surface\ngradient @h/@y when approaching the lateral margins and\nthe transverse velocity decreases (@v/@t < 0). However, the\ndeceleration in the transverse direction is much smaller than\nthe deceleration in the downslope direction because of the\nhigher driving force fpy than that in the x direction (j@h/@yj >\nj@h/@xj) near the margins. The total velocity therefore\nrotates toward the transverse direction and decreases with\ntime when approaching the lateral borders of the flow\n(Figure 17). In our simple model, the increase of the friction\nwith decreasing thickness may then be the process respon-\nsible for the creation of shoulders bordering the flow. The\ncomplex competition between the pressure force and the\nfriction when the thickness decreases seems to be a key\nmechanism controlling the dynamics of the front.",

The fact that the front reaches a\nsteady velocity and shape along the plane seems to be\nresponsible of the width chosen by the flow. In the simplified\nmodel used here, the formation of shoulders channeling the\nflow has been shown to result from the balance between a\nfriction force with a friction coefficient depending on the\nthickness of the flow and the driving forces due to gravity and\nsurface slope. The competition between these forces leads to\nrotation of the velocity vector from the downslope direction\nwithin the central channel to the transverse direction when\napproaching the lateral border of the flow. The complex\ncompetition between the pressure force and the friction when\nthe thickness decreases seems to be a key mechanism\ncontrolling the dynamics of the front. The balance of forces\nwould be different if stresses on planes normal to the bed\nwere taken into account. In that case, the increasing dissipa-\ntion near the lateral borders behind the front would be\nexpected to be due to the increasing downslope gradient of\nthe thickness when moving from the center of the lobe toward\nthe lateral margins. Simulation of self-channelling flows and\nanalysis of the balance of forces using more sophisticated\nmodels such as the one proposed by Denlinger and Iverson\n[2004] would provide insight into the role of the different\ncomponents of the stress tensor in the creation of quasi-static\nzones. Furthermore, it could be a way to understand the basis\nof the m parameterization.",

        "text": "[70] The steady regime obtained in the central channel\nappears to be very similar to that observed on uniform\nlaterally confined flows. The calculated flow within the\ncentral channel almost reaches a steady state with a constant\nvalue of the thickness and velocity at a given position. We\nhave investigated the variation of the friction coefficient\nduring the flow. The nonuniformity in space involving\nsurface gradients locally modifies the steady coefficient of\nfriction calculated by the numerical model, which appears to\nbe slightly different from the case of steady uniform\nconfined flow (m = tan q). The dependence on the velocity\nof the friction coefficient appears to be weak. In fact, once\nthe flow has developed, the Froude number is almost\nconstant because the velocity varies like the wave velocity\nin shallow flow. The metastable regime is thoroughly\ninvestigated by the flow near the developing quasi-static\nmargins. The accurate description of this regime is therefore\nessential when modeling the dynamics of these zones and\nthe shape of the levees. However, in the case of our model,\nthe granular material never stops as long as the supply is\nmaintained as observed experimentally [Deboeuf et al.,\n2006]. This suggests that the use of two friction angles,\nnamely a static and a dynamic friction angle, is not\nnecessary to explain self-channelling flows.",
