In the\nAtlantic, many reef and mound complexes are engineered by\nLophelia pertusa, the dominant framework-forming coral.\nIn this study, a variety of mapping approaches were used at a\nrange of scales to map the distribution of both cold-water\ncoral habitats and individual coral colonies at the Mingulay\nReef Complex (west Scotland). The new ArcGIS-based\nBritish Geological Survey (BGS) seabed mapping toolbox\nsemi-automatically delineated over 500 Lophelia reef ‘mini-\nmounds’ from bathymetry data with 2-m resolution. The\nmorphometric and acoustic characteristics of the mini-\nmounds were also automatically quantiﬁed and captured",

Lophelia pertusa can be deﬁned as an\n‘ecosystem engineer’ (Jones et al. 1994) as reefs formed by\nthis coral alter the local hydrodynamics and sediment\ndeposition\nand\nprovide\na\ncomplex\nthree-dimensional\nhabitat for many other species including communities of\nsuspension-feeding invertebrates such as sponges and other\ncorals (Jensen and Frederiksen 1992; Henry and Roberts\n2007; Buhl-Mortensen et al. 2010).\nLophelia pertusa reefs form under speciﬁc environ-\nmental conditions that are not yet fully understood (Davies\net al. 2008; Howell et al. 2011) but which are known to be\ncontrolled by a complex interplay of physical, chemical\nand biological factors (Thiem et al. 2006). Lophelia per-\ntusa is a widely distributed species that requires a hard\nsubstrate such as boulders, pebbles or shells for initial\nattachment (Wilson 1979; Hovland et al. 2005). It is\npreferentially associated with areas of accelerated near-bed\ncurrents which are often found on sloping topographies and\ntopographic highs (Genin et al. 1986; Frederiksen et al.\n1992). This is because the living coral polyps feed on\nparticles suspended in the water, and the encounter rate of\nfood increases with higher current speeds (Frederiksen\net al. 1992; Mortensen 2001; Thiem et al. 2006). In par-\nticular, phytoplankton is predominantly captured at higher\nﬂow velocities of 0.5 cm s-1, but zooplankton is success-\nfully captured at lower ﬂow velocities of 0.2 cm s-1.\nLophelia pertusa can occur at depths of 39–3380 m. The\ncorals are associated with temperatures between 4 and\n13 \u0003C (Roberts et al. 2009a) and an oceanic salinity around\n35 on the practical scale (Freiwald et al. 2004).\nIn this study, we focus on the Mingulay Reef Complex\n(MRC) (Fig. 1) located off the west coast of Scotland,\nwhere L. pertusa is the framework-forming coral. The\nMRC is a collection of several areas supporting reef\nmounds (Roberts et al. 2005). It is located in the Sea of\nHebrides, south of the Little Minch in a passage between\nthe Scottish mainland and the northern Inner and Outer\nHebrides.\nTo date, predictive mapping of deep-sea organisms and\nhabitats has mainly been based on video data, with or\nwithout grab or trawl samples (Roberts et al. 2009b; Henry\net al. 2010; Howell et al. 2011). The advantage of video\nover sampling is that it covers large areas without dis-\nturbing the habitat. The exact position and local environ-\nment of the organisms are more uncertain for grab and\ntrawl samples taken without precise in-water positioning,\nbut they do provide higher detail and conﬁdence when\nidentifying species at lower taxonomic levels (De Clippele\net al. 2015). A second drawback of biological sampling for\npredictive mapping is uncertainty regarding the absence of",

Even when large areas are covered with video\nsurveys, the presence of a species that occurs outside the\nrange of the camera’s view can be missed.\nTo\novercome\nthese\ndrawbacks,\na\nhigh-resolution\nmicrobathymetric grid (0.35 9 0.35 m) is used in this\nstudy. This grid covered a wider continuous area compared\nto a narrower, and discontinuous area covered by high-\ndeﬁnition (HD) video transects. The microbathymetric grid\nallowed identiﬁcation and mapping of individual coral\ncolonies in their local spatial setting (Fig. 1c). HD video\ntransects matching the colonies on the microbathymetry\nconﬁrmed that the colonies were alive. Live coral presence\nand\nabsence\ndata\nwere\nintegrated\nfrom\nthe\nmicro-\nbathymetry\nwith\na\nbroader\nresolution\nbathymetry\n(2 9 2 m) from which additional environmental variables\nwere derived. Live coral presence data for areas outside the\nmicrobathymetry were included by using HD video\ntransects.\nHere, the focus lies on the east–west-oriented ridge of\nthe MRC, Mingulay Reef 01 (MR1) (Fig. 1b), where we\nspeciﬁcally studied live coral growth on the most extensive\narea of small Lophelia reef mounds in the MRC. Small reef\nmounds, referred to as ‘mini-mounds’, are widespread on\nMR1. In the spring and summer months, the water at the\nMRC is very turbid, caused by ﬂocculent marine snow and\nsome resuspension of existing seabed sediments (Fyfe et al.\n1993), and the low visibility can interfere with the quality\nof video data. This near-seabed particle ﬂux is caused by\ntwo mechanisms. The ﬁrst is a rapid downwelling motion\ncreated during ebb and ﬂood periods as an internal wave\nbreaks over the largest of the ﬁve reef complexes, MR1\n(Fig. 1b) (Davies et al. 2009). The ridge of MR1 is com-\nprised of dolerite (Roberts et al. 2005). The ridge is rela-\ntively shallow with the shallowest point rising to less than\n100 m water depth and the deepest point reaching 260 m.\nThe hydraulic ﬂow (or ‘jump’) can cause a depression of\nthe downstream density structure which, when the tide\nreverses, is propagated back over the bank. This results in a\nsupply of warmer, nutrient-rich water from the surface to\nMR1 (Davies et al. 2009). Organic matter resuspended\nfrom the seabed during peak tidal ﬂows will be lower in\nquality but is a second mechanism of food supply.\nA new British Geological Survey (BGS) seabed mapping\ntoolbox was developed for the ArcGIS software to delineate\nthe mini-mounds at MR1 semi-automatically from the\nbroader-scale bathymetry data (2 9 2 m) and was used for\nthe ﬁrst time in this study. Cold-water corals occur at great\ndepth, and therefore, the development of remote sensing\napproaches with semi-automatic systems is important. As\nmultibeam bathymetry is commonly available for cold-water\ncoral ecosystems, a potential wider application of this tool is\npossible. The characteristics of the mini-mounds that are",

The data were recorded with a combina-\ntion of cameras mounted on the ROV: an HD Insite mini-\nZeus video camera with a direct HDSDI ﬁbre output, a\nKongsberg 14-208 digital still camera, a Kongsberg 14-366\npan and tilt camera and an Insite Pegasus-plus ﬁxed zoom\ncamera. Four lights were used: two 400-W deep-sea power\nand light SeaArc2 HMI lights and two 25,000 lm Cathx\nocean APHOS LED lights. Two deep-sea power lasers\nspaced 10 cm were also mounted on the HD camera. The\nposition and depth of the ROV were determined by USBL\n(Sonardyne) underwater positioning system and recorded\nusing the OFOP (Ocean Floor Observation Protocol)\nsoftware.",

        "text": "Development of the BGS seabed mapping toolbox for\nArcGIS started after the successful creation of a semi-au-\ntomatic workﬂow that can map and characterise pockmarks\nin the seabed (Gafeira et al. 2012). However, the approach\nhad to be reversed to map positive features in areas of\ncomplex seabed morphology. The new workﬂow can be\nrun as an ArcGIS tool. The ﬁrst tool in the toolbox was\nnamed the BPI feature delineation tool. The script behind\nthis tool follows a similar logic to the script developed for\nmapping pockmarks (Gafeira et al. 2012). The main dif-\nference is the use of the bathymetric positioning index\n(BPI) as an input instead of using bathymetric data directly.\nThe BPI uses neighbourhood analyses to calculate the\nrelative elevation of a cell compared to the surrounding\ncells, identifying topographic features. Positive BPI values\nrepresent locations that are shallower than the average of\ntheir surroundings (e.g., ridges). Negative BPI values rep-\nresent locations that are deeper than their surroundings.\nBPI values near zero are either ﬂat areas or areas of con-\nstant slope (Weiss 2001). By using the BPI values as an\ninput, the delineation will depend dramatically on how the\nBPI map was calculated. Here, the BPI was calculated\nwithin ArcGIS with the land facet corridor tool (Jenness\net al. 2013). The used neighbourhood’s shape (annulus) and\nsize (inner and outer radius of 8 and 24 cells, respectively)\nwere chosen based on the characteristics of the study area\n(e.g., typical width of the mini-mounds, distance between\nfeatures).\nIn the BPI feature delineation tool, several thresholds\nare decided by the user to determine the delineation pro-\ncess. These are the cutline BPI value, minimum BPI,\nminimum area and a minimum width/length ratio (Gafeira\net al. 2015). Additionally, a buffer distance can also be\ndeﬁned within the tool dialogue box. This is applied to the\npolygons delineated to compensate for the fact that the\ndelineation process was based on the cutline BPI value,\nwhich normally reaches the mound’s lateral slopes rather\nthan its base. The tool output is a polygon shapeﬁle\ndelineating the areas of seabed respecting the dimensions\nand BPI values set by the user. A cutline BPI value of 3,\nminimum BPI value of 3.5, minimum area of 50 m2 and a\nminimum width/length ratio of 0.2 were used as the\nthresholds. A buffer distance of 4 m was chosen based on\nthe morphological characteristics of the mounds and how\nthey are represented in the BPI raster used as data input.\nNevertheless, some degree of manual editing was required\nwhen adjacent mini-mounds were delineated as a single\nfeature (Fig. 2). More detailed information regarding the\nBPI feature delineation tool and the results of the sensi-\ntivity to the BPI input and threshold values can be found in\nGafeira et al. (2015).\nThe table of attributes of the output shapeﬁle of the BPI\nfeature delineation tool captures some characteristics of the",

However,\nafter manually editing the outline of some of the polygons\nthe information on it could be partially incorrect. The\nsecond tool in the toolbox, the feature description tool,\nrecalculates these attribute values for each feature before\nadding new attribute ﬁelds with additional information. At\nthis\npoint\nof\nthe\ntoolbox\ndevelopment,\nthe\nfeature\ndescription tool allows extraction of information from the\noriginal digital elevation model (DEM), the BPI map,\nbackscatter and rugosity map. Backscatter data give\ninformation on the physical attributes of the seabed (Todd\net al. 1999; Kostylev et al. 2001). High values tend to\nrepresent substrates that are more reﬂective, such as\nboulders or rocks. Lower values represent environments\nwhere reﬂection by the substrate is lower, such as muddy\nareas. Rugosity was calculated as the standard deviation of\nthe slope in ArcGIS. It is a measure of terrain roughness\nand is obtained as the ratio of the 3D surface area to the\nplanar area within a neighbourhood (3 9 3 cells) (Jenness\n2002). This tool can also calculate the assumed initial slope\nof the seabed surface before the development of the coral\nmound. The initial slope is calculated by removing the\nbathymetric information from inside the delineated mini-\nmounds and generating a new surface by interpolating from\nthe surrounding bathymetric values. The mean value of the\nassumed initial slope within each mini-mound is extracted\nand added to the table attributes. This tool can extract 20\ndescriptive attributes (Table 1). Of these, minimum/maxi-\nmum\nvertical\nrelief,\nminimum/mean/maximum\nwater\ndepth, water depth of the deepest conﬁned contour line,\nwidth, length and orientation are illustrated in Fig. 3.\nCurrent data were not extracted automatically by the tool",

More\nbackground information about the application can be found\nin Cutler et al. (2007) and Rogan et al. (2008). All clas-\nsiﬁcations were carried out in R version 3.2.2 (R Devel-\nopment Core Team 2013) using the random forest package\nv.1.6-7 (Liaw and Wiener 2002). Here, the mini-mounds as\na whole are used as samples. Three different models were\ncompared. In the ﬁrst model, the percentage of live coral\ncover on the mounds was modelled in the ﬁve different\nclasses (120 samples). In the second model, we modelled\nthe presence/absence of live corals on the mounds within\nthe microbathymetry (120 samples). In the third model, the\npresence of live coral samples from the HD video analyses\nwas included in the presence/absence model (132 samples).\nThe RF classiﬁcation models were assessed based on ran-\ndom separation of training and test (validation) data. This\nwas done by leaving one-third of the data out for model\ntraining and subsequently using them to test the model.

The microbathymetry provided very clear morpho-\nlogical evidence for the presence of live coral colonies and\nallowed us to calculate the percentage living coral cover on\nthe mini-mounds of MR1. The BGS seabed mapping\ntoolbox was an efﬁcient and reliable tool to identify these\nmini-mounds rapidly and to calculate a variety of envi-\nronmental factors for each mini-mound. By integrating\nthese data sets, a quick assessment of the morphology of\nthe mini-mounds and the environmental factors that\ndetermine which mini-mounds support or do not support\nlive coral is possible. Here, the strongest explanatory\nmodel was computed for coral presence/absence with HD\nvideo samples.",

The microbathymetry showed that mini-\nmounds without live coral were more abundant on the\nupper part of the ridge, while mini-mounds with live corals\nwere more likely to be found at the edges of the ridge of\nMR1 (Figs. 5, 6, 10). The proximity of the mini-mounds to\nthe surface could be a factor contributing to coral absence.\nMingulay Reef is mainly supplied with food from surface\nwaters through tidal downwelling, which changes envi-\nronmental conditions experienced by the corals semi-di-\nurnally (Davies et al. 2009; Findlay et al. 2013). The range\nof environmental changes is not consistent with depth\n(Findlay et al. 2013), which could contribute to the absence",

This is a variable that is more related to the\nmorphological properties of the mini-mound and is there-\nfore not an independent characteristic of the mini-mound.\nMini-mounds with high live coral cover are more likely to\nhave greater maximum and mean rugosity than mini-\nmounds with only dead corals. When the growth of corals\nincreases, the unevenness of the mound structure increases\nas the coral polyps grow outwards to obtain better passing\nfood. Mini-mounds composed of rubble without live coral,\ncovered\nby\nParazoanthus\nanguicomus\nand\nsediment\n(Fig. 4), have lower rugosity as there is less morphological\ncomplexity (observation from HD videos). Erosional pro-\ncesses will also reduce the unevenness of the mound and of\nthe reef structure, as when the corals die, the underlying\nframework may be rapidly bioeroded until it collapses.\nRugosity is easily calculated from bathymetry and can,\ntherefore, be used to identify the potential occurrence of\ncold-water corals in other areas.\nAs anticipated, BPI was higher for mini-mounds with\nliving coral colonies. Corals are typically associated with\nareas of accelerated near-bed currents which are often\nfound on sloping topographies and topographic highs\nbecause the encounter rate of food increases with higher\ncurrent speeds (Genin et al. 1986; Frederiksen et al. 1992\nMortensen 2001; Thiem et al. 2006).

This study highlights the advantage of\nusing microbathymetry, which allowed us to observe real\npresence and absence complemented with HD video data to\nidentify live coral colonies. However, a wider coverage of\nmicrobathymetry would allow better coverage of both\npresence and absence of live coral over the range of\nenvironmental variables.

        "text": "any changes could result in a smaller optimal growth range\nat the MRC and other reefs that thrive in similar conditions.\nOcean acidiﬁcation is of major concern for many marine\necosystems, particularly calciﬁers already growing in water\nmasses close to carbonate under-saturation such as cold-\nwater coral reefs (Guinotte et al. 2006; Roberts et al. 2006;\nTurley et al. 2006; Aze et al. 2014; Hennige et al. 2014).\nOcean acidiﬁcation impacts not only surface waters but the\ncarbonate chemistry at depth (Caldeira and Wickett 2003).\nStudies on ocean acidiﬁcation suggest that ocean pH will\ndecrease by approximate 0.3–0.4 pH units by the end of the\ncentury (Guinotte et al. 2006; Roberts et al. 2006; Turley\net al. 2006). This will also inﬂuence the depth of the\naragonite saturation horizon (ASH), which creates condi-\ntions that are less favourable for skeletal growth (Orr et al.\n2005; Guinotte et al. 2006; Turley et al. 2007). However,\nthe MRC is unlikely to be affected by the shoaling of the\nASH. This makes the reef a possible site of interest as a\nrefuge for cold-water corals in a future ocean where ocean\nacidiﬁcation has negatively impacted deeper corals. For the\nMRC seasonal surface uptake of food, coastal run-off and\nincreasing seawater temperatures will be of higher impor-\ntance than the effects of ocean acidiﬁcation (Findlay et al.\n2013). Findlay et al. (2013) showed that cold-water coral\nreefs like the MRC may be subjected to a more variable\nbiogeochemical environment than previously thought.\nHennige et al. (2015) showed that L. pertusa can adapt to a\ncombination of increasing CO2 and temperatures at the\nsame time. However, this adaptation came with a trade-off\nfor the physical strength of the coral. Coral colonies will,\ntherefore, be likely to be more affected by bioerosion and\nphysical damage by 2100.\nOur detailed map of the current presence of live corals\non mini-mounds can function as a baseline and tool for\nfuture sampling and monitoring. Even though the bathy-\nmetry and video data were collected over several years, the\nimpact on our results would be minimal. Growth rates of L.\npertusa vary widely, ranging from 2.6 to 20–25 mm yr-1.\nEven if corals grew at their maximum growth rate of\n25 mm yr-1 from 2003 to 2012, the corals would have\nonly grown 225 mm. After testing the model by ground-\ntruthing, this approach could be used to guide sampling\ntowards mounds with the highest probability of coral\npresence to maximise ship time.\nPresent and past small-scale hydrodynamic data could\nshed light on the processes that shaped the current distri-\nbution of the mini-mounds on the MRC. Long-term tem-\nperature measurements are lacking; by obtaining this data,\nthe sensitivity of the MRC to climate warming could be\nexplored in more detail. We show that live coral colonies\ncan be identiﬁed from a microbathymetry map. Micro-\nbathymetry maps of other parts of the reef can, therefore,\nbe useful for further monitoring and can be used to ground-",
