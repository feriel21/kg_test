        "text": "Large submarine landslides can have serious socioeconomic consequences as they have the potential to\ncause tsunamis and damage seabed infrastructure. It is important to understand the frequency of these\nlandslides, and how that frequency is related to climate-driven factors such as sea level or sedimentation\nrate, in order to assess their occurrence in the future. Recent studies have proposed that more landslides\noccur during periods of sea level rise and lowstand, or during periods of rapid sedimentation. In this\ncontribution we test these hypotheses by analysing the most comprehensive global data set of ages for\nlarge (>1 km3) late Quaternary submarine landslides that has been compiled to date. We include the\nuncertainties in each landslide age that arise from both the dating technique, and the typically larger\nuncertainties that result from the position of the samples used for dating. Contrary to the hypothesis that\ncontinental slope stability is linked to sea level change, the data set does not show statistically signiﬁcant\npatterns, trends or clusters in landslide abundance. If such a link between sea level and landslide fre-\nquency exists it is too weak to be detected using the available global data base. It is possible that con-\ntrolling factors vary between different geographical areas, and their role is therefore hidden in a global\ndata set, or that the uncertainties within the dates is too great to see an underlying correlation. Our\nanalysis also shows that there is no evidence for an immediate inﬂuence of rapid sedimentation on slope\nstability as failures tend to occur several thousand years after periods of increased sedimentation rates.\nThe results imply that there is not a strong global correlation of landslide frequency with sea level\nchanges or increases in local sedimentation rate, based on the currently available ages for large sub-\nmarine landslides.\n\u0001 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The landslides themselves can damage\nseaﬂoor infrastructure, such as that used to recover oil and gas, or\nseaﬂoor telecommunication cables that carry more than 95% of the\nglobal internet trafﬁc. Such cables were broken by a large subma-\nrine landslide and the ﬂow of sediment it generated off Grand\nBanks, Canada, in 1929 (Piper and Aksu, 1987). Numerous hy-\npotheses have been put forward for what causes large submarine\nlandslides, including earthquakes, rapid deposition or gas hydrate\ndissociation (e.g. Maslin et al., 1998; Stigall and Dugan, 2010;\nMasson et al., 2011). These hypotheses are poorly tested, and even\nless is known about the effect of other preconditioning factors such\nas ﬂuid ﬂow focussing in the slope (Dugan, 2012).\nIt has been proposed that future climatic change and ocean\nwarming may increase the frequency of large submarine landslides,\nsuch as through triggering by gas hydrate dissociation (Maslin et al.,\n1998; Tappin, 2010). It is therefore important to know if past large\nlandslides coincided with major climatic events, or were more\nfrequent during periods of rising sea level.

The timing of\nlandslides and factors such as sea level or sedimentation rate can\npotentially provide a test for failure mechanism hypotheses.\nComparisons of landslide frequency with sea level have been\nundertaken previously by Maslin et al. (2004), Owen et al. (2007),\nLee (2009), and Leynaud et al. (2009), who used compilations of\nbetween 16 and 43 large submarine landslides. All studies suggest\nan increased landslide occurrence during periods of glaciation and/\nor during glacial to interglacial transitions. Several other authors\nreport an increased recurrence interval of submarine landslides\nfrom various geographical locations worldwide during sea level\nlowstand and during sea level rise (e.g. Paull et al., 1996; Prins et al.,\n2000; Piper et al., 2003; Lebreiro et al., 2009; Henrich et al., 2010;\nLee et al., 2010). These studies are largely qualitative and are not\nsupported by any rigorous statistical analysis. Importantly, they do\nnot take fully into account uncertainties in the determination of\nlandslide ages. These uncertainties can be large, as illustrated by\nchanges in understanding of the age(s) of the Storegga slide. Early\nstudies were based on three cores containing turbidites deposited\nin an adjacent depositional basin that had no physical connection to\nthe Storegga slide scars. The slide was interpreted as a three-phase\nevent, one of which was older than 30 ka (Bugge et al., 1988). This\nwas then revised by later work that used a more extensive (>90)\ncore data set (Haﬂidason et al., 2005), to show that the slide was\none main event that occurred w8100 years ago. This signiﬁcant\nchange in age of the Storegga slide is cautionary, as many other\nslides are dated using small core data sets comparable to that\noriginally used to date Storegga and similar scientiﬁc approaches to\nobtain landslide ages (e.g. Pearce and Jarvis, 1992; Wynn et al.,\n2002).\nMoreover, the age of a landslide is always accompanied by an\nuncertainty interval as the accurate age determination is compli-\ncated by a number of factors. The main uncertainty is typically\nrelated to the location of samples, not the uncertainty in the dating\nmethod, which is often radiocarbon dating. Samples for dating\nsubmarine landslides can originate from its source area (scar) or the",

The ages are derived by\ndating of the landslide itself, or by dating of the turbidite generated\nby a landslide. Only landslides (or turbidites) with volumes in\nexcess of 1 km3 are included in this study. Each data point under-\nwent a critical review to avoid interpretation errors and is assigned\nan individual uncertainty interval.\nThe ﬁrst aim is to address the following questions. Given the\navailable ages for these landslides, and taking into account un-\ncertainties in these ages, is there an association between sea level\nand the timing of seaﬂoor failure? Does landslide frequency vary\nsigniﬁcantly with sea level, or could the pattern of landslide ages be\nrandom and unrelated to sea level? We apply basic statistics to the\ndata set and assess whether the impact of sea level cycles on\nlandslide timing is as strong as previously suggested (Maslin et al.,\n2004; Owen et al., 2007; Lee, 2009).\nThe data set is then subdivided to consider the frequency of\nlandslides in different settings that comprise (i) glaciated margins,\n(ii) river-dominated systems, (iii) sediment-starved margins, and\n(iv) the north-west African margin where there is an extensive data\nset. This is done to accomplish the second aim. Is there a signiﬁcant\nassociation between landslide timing and sea level in particular\nsubsets of the data?",

Deposition rates\nOne factor often assumed as the driving mechanism for subma-\nrine landslides is high rates of deposition that cause overpressure in\nthe sediment (e.g. Stigall and Dugan, 2010). This is because rapid\nsedimentation favours the retention of pore ﬂuid, and development\nof high excess pore pressures. The amount of terrestrial sediment\nthat is transported intothe ocean is mainlycontrolled by weathering\npatterns in the hinterlands, which are subjected to glacialeinter-\nglacial shifts of climate belts. The interplay with many other factors,\nfor example a regional time delay between climate-driven onshore\nchanges and offshore deposition (e.g. Métiver and Gaudemer, 1999;\nCastelltort and VanDenDriessche, 2003) make the sedimentation\nhistories of different continental margins variable (e.g. Nittrouer,\n2007; Covault and Graham, 2010).\nIn high latitudes terrestrial sediment input is highest during\nglacial periods due to erosion at the base of ice sheets which then\nextend to the shelf edge (Vorren et al., 1998; Weaver et al., 2000;\nRørvik et al., 2010). Across-shelf oriented ice streams drain the ice\nsheets and therewith provide effective transport of eroded mate-\nrial. Consequently, large depocentres of glacigenic sediments\n(trough mouth fans) develop in front of these ice streams. This\nprocess stops as soon as ice sheets retreat, leaving a minor terres-\ntrial input to the ocean by meltwater and a signiﬁcantly smaller\nsedimentation rate (Dowdeswell and Elverhøi, 2002; Rørvik et al.,\n2010). Mulder and Moran (1995) suggest that not only elevated\ndeposition rates at glaciated margins during glaciations but also the\nweight of the ice sheet causes excess pore pressure in the sediment.\nDuring glacial periods in moderate latitudes the ice was\nconcentrated inland and did not reach the shelves (Clark et al.,",

Stress changes\nPrevious work has suggested that sea level ﬂuctuations impact\non slope stability directly (Weaver and Kuijpers, 1983; Lee et al.,\n1996), as they alter the stress regime at the seaﬂoor. It is impor-\ntant to understand that sea level ﬂuctuations change hydrostatic\npore water pressure (the weight of all the water above). This\ndirectly affects the total stress (the total load experienced at a\npoint), which is the sum of the effective stress and the pore water\npressure. The fraction of the applied load that is borne by the pore\nﬂuid is given by the loading efﬁciency a. For shallow marine sedi-\nments a ¼ 0.97 (Liu and Flemings, 2009), i.e. a change in total stress\nis almost entirely borne by the pore pressure (97%) and the effective\nstress changes only slightly (3%). Therefore, from a geomechanical\npoint of view, the direct impact of changing sea level on slope\nstability is likely to be minimal.\nFree gas is affected more strongly by a change in sea level as it\ndepends on total stress. If gas is present in the pore space during sea\nlevel fall, the pore pressure drops less than the total stress due to\nthe high compressibility of gas and overpressure develops (Liu and\nFlemings, 2009).

Oxygen isotopes\nOxygen isotope stratigraphy is the preferred method for dating\nmarine sediments older than 50 ka, and those with a low biogenic\ncontent (Prell et al., 1986). The amount of 18O/16O in hand picked\ncalcareous shells of microorganisms is measured in a mass spec-\ntrometer and the resulting isotope record has a dominant glaciale\ninterglacial signal (Shackleton and Opdyke, 1973). The relationship\nof this isotope record to age is obtained by orbital tuning (e.g.\nImbrie et al., 1984). The isotope content is measured preferably on\nbenthic foraminifera as, while alive, they were subjected to a much\nsmaller range of temperature due to relatively stable deep water\ntemperatures (Shackleton and Opdyke, 1973).\nUncertainties in this method may arise from bioturbation that\nmixes foraminifera up or down the core. For instance, Hutson\n(1980) reports a 4.5 ka uncertainty for oxygen isotope stratig-\nraphy due to bioturbation at Oxygen Isotope Stage boundaries.\nUncertainties will be higher for cases with relatively low abundance\nor variations in abundance of the species on which the isotopes are\nmeasured (Hutson, 1980). Differences within one species, as well as\nphysiological differences between different species, may also result\nin different 18O/16O ratios. Moreover, below a certain water depth\n(ocean dependent, typically between 3\u00015 km), the carbonate in\nforaminifera shells begin to dissolve (Berger, 1972). At ages older\nthan the 14C range (50 ka) the isotope record is tied in to absolute\nages by orbital tuning which can introduce maximum errors of\nabout 5 ka (Martinson et al., 1987). If an uncertainty range is not\ngiven in the original publication, information on the data in such\ndetail that would allow to estimate the individual uncertainty\nrange is often not provided either. Thus, there is a need for a uni-\nform uncertainty range which takes into account all possible un-\ncertainties named above. For the purpose of this study, we thus\nassume uncertainties involved with oxygen isotopes to be about\n5 ka for the period 0e50 ka, and about 10 ka for older samples. This",

Uncertainties due to sample locations\nBy far the largest source of uncertainty originates from the\npositioning of the sample in the sediment core relative to the\nlandslide deposit or scar. Ideally, samples are taken from hemi-\npelagic background sediment deposited after the event (Fig. 1a and\nb) to provide a minimum landslide age. For cores retrieved from\nthe depositional zone samples may also be taken from the hemi-\npelagic sediment deposited before the event (Fig. 1c) to provide a\ntime bracket for the maximum landslide age. The sample is pref-\nerably taken very close to the landslide deposit or scar, whilst at\nthe same time avoiding sediment mixing by bioturbation or bot-\ntom currents (Fig. 1g). This method is favoured by rapid sedi-\nmentation rates, and is more problematic in areas with low\nsedimentation rates. The time interval between deposition of the\nsediment from which the sample is taken and the actual event\nshould be calculated based on local sedimentation rates and added\nor subtracted to the estimated age of the sample. Uncertainties\narising from this interpolation can be large, especially when\naccumulation rates are low or unknown (Fig. 1e), but can be\nreduced by taking several samples to better constrain the sedi-\nmentation rate history (Fig. 1b and e).\nSamples taken above the landslide scar or deposit (Fig. 1a) can\ngive an age that is too young if the samples are located on a local\nhigh within a geometrically irregular deposit. Post-failure sedi-\nmentation on a local high in a hummocky deposit can result in a\nlocal reduction in sedimentation rate, or even a hiatus (Fig. 1f).\nSamples taken above the landslide deposit can also return an age\nolder than the actual emplacement age. This occurs if the landslide\ndeposit carries abundant microfossils that are affected by bio-\nturbation and reworking of this deposit (Fig. 1g). On the contrary, if\nthe landslide deposit has low carbonate content, the contamination\nby bioturbation is less important. It is generally best to obtain\nmultiple dates in the sediment that drapes a landslide, such that the\naccumulation rate can be used to extrapolate a more precise age for\nthe upper surface of the landslide (Fig. 1b and e).\nSamples taken below the landslide deposit (Fig. 1c) can return\nmuch older ages than the emplacement age. This is because the\nbase of the landslide is likely to erode underlying background\nsediment, and the uncertainty depends on the depth of erosion.\nDating the landslide deposit itself (Fig.1d) gives a maximum age\nfor the failure.

In some cases several lobes are\nmapped which could have been created successively during one\nevent, as in the Storegga slide (Haﬂidason et al., 2005). However,\nthey could have also been emplaced at longer time intervals and\nthus represent several separate events (Georgiopoulou et al., 2009;\nFörster et al., 2010). It is therefore important to take cores from all\nlobes in order to correctly interpret the timing of the events and to\nunderstand their temporal evolution. This is not always the case\nand increases the level of uncertainty. For instance, four deposi-\ntional lobes are observed in the Trænadjupet slide area (Laberg\net al., 2002b). Although radiocarbon ages have only been deter-\nmined for one of the lobes, the slide has been interpreted as one\nsingle event (Laberg et al., 2002a,b). The same principle holds if a\nlandslide area shows multiple headwalls. Ideally, cores need to be\ntaken from all scars to constrain the timing between single events.\nThese error sources are not predictable and are therefore not\nincluded in any error estimations.

Ideally, several radiocarbon ages\nare available in the hemipelagic sediment above the landslide de-\nposit (Fig. 1b) as the sedimentation history can be determined with\na higher resolution and changes in sedimentation rates can be\ndetected (Fig. 1e, open circles).

If only one age above the deposit is available (Fig. 1a), a\nlinear sedimentation rate from the seaﬂoor to the sample must be\nassumed (Fig. 1e, ﬁlled circles). Consequently, both the errors for\nthe 14C measurements and an uncertainty due to simpliﬁcation of\nsedimentation rate propagate into the ﬁnal sedimentation rate that\nis used for the age estimate of a submarine landslide.

The reason for the subdivision is\nthat changes in sea level and climate are likely to impact different\ndepositional environments in different ways.\nGlaciated margins are thought to be strongly inﬂuenced by cli-\nmatic cycles due to the direct inﬂuence of a growing and shrinking\nice sheet and a signiﬁcantly higher sediment input during glacials\n(Owen et al., 2007; Lee, 2009). In contrast, most river deltas\nexperience the highest sediment input during deglaciation (sea\nlevel rise) or lowstands (Covault and Graham, 2010). As rivers\neffectively transport terrestrial sediment (Milliman and Syvitski,\n1992) this subset of river fan systems is also characterised by\ngenerally high deposition rates (>1 m/ka).\nA third subset comprises stretches of continental margins\ncharacterised by rather low sediment deposition rates (<1 m/ka).\nThis includes areas that have not been affected by ice sheet\ncoverage, are located away from major river fan systems, or have\nexperienced strong bottom currents that prevent sediment depo-\nsition. This subset, referred to here as ‘sediment-starved conti-\nnental margins’ includes for instance the north-west African, the\nsouth-east Australian and US east coast margins. However, there\nmight be an element of the river fan systems subset in this group, as\nrivers are dynamic systems and highly inﬂuenced by local climate\nin the hinterland. Although virtually no rivers are known from the\nSahara today, there is strong evidence for the existence of paleo-\nrivers (e.g. Pachur and Kröpelin, 1987).\nData from the north-west African margin is also taken as a\nseparate group. This data set is unusually extensive and contains\nseveral very large landslides mapped along the continental slope as\nwell as turbidity currents from the same sediment-starved area.",

Bias due to limited core penetration\nIn some cases scientiﬁc drill cores provide information about old\nburied landslides (e.g. Maslin et al., 1998), although only few\nlandslides haven been drilled. Therefore, the majority of submarine\nlandslides in the data set are sampled by box, piston or gravity\ncorers. These devices have a limited penetration depth (<30 m)\nwhich strongly depends on the nature and fabric of the sediment.\nThus, the material obtained only covers a short time interval,\nespecially in areas of high sedimentation rates such as in river fans.\nIn many cases the core does not penetrate the entire failed mass, so\nthat deeply buried landslide deposits are not sampled. Cores in\nturbidite systems sometimes recover several sequences of landslide\ndeposits (Table 1 and references therein), but even then the re-\ncovery is limited. Table 1 summarises the age limits and maximum\npenetration depths for several turbidite studies. This data shows\nthat in most cases the cores date back no further than w30 ka BP,\nwhich corresponds roughly to the onset of the Last Glacial\nMaximum (LGM). It is therefore not possible to evaluate the fre-\nquency of landslides which occurred before the LGM.\nDue to the bias towards younger landslides, we use a cut-off age\nof 30 ka. We assume that landslides younger than 30 ka are in most\ncases unaffected by this sampling bias (Table 1). Exceptions may\noccur in environments with rapid deposition of coarse sediment,",

Failures at the north-west African continental slope\nas well as at glaciated margins are regularly spaced over time. The\nlatter is interesting, as it has been suggested previously that the\nstability of glaciated margins is heavily affected by climatic changes\nowing to the direct impact of ice sheet advances and retreats or\nsurging of glaciers (Owen et al., 2007; Tappin, 2010) as well as\ncatastrophic ﬂoods during glacialeinterglacial transition (Piper and\nNormark, 2009). The frequency of landslides at sediment-starved\nmargins increases slightly towards the end of the LGM. Failures at\nriver fan systems cluster in the past 30 ka which is most likely an\nartifact of sampling bias considering high sedimentation rates\nusually involved in river dominated systems. The landslide fre-\nquency was highest during sea level rise (1.4 failures per ka), in-\ntermediate during the LGM and the modern highstand (1 and\n0.7 failures per ka, respectively) and comparatively low during\ntimes of falling sea level (0.4 failures per ka). The landslide fre-\nquency of the river subset during the past 30 ka is remarkably\nsimilar to that of the entire data set. It is thus evident that the river-\nsubgroup dominates the overall data set. As for the uncategorised\ndata, the peak in landslide frequency during sea level rise following\nthe LGM is not statistically signiﬁcant.",

As we do not observe a signiﬁcant correlation of\nlandslide timings with global climate or sea level, rapid sedimen-\ntation rates do not seem to be important as a direct cause for slope\nfailure. However, an indirect impact on the stability of continental\nslopes is possible. Excess pore pressure develop as a result of rapid\nloading which decrease the strength and ‘precondition’ the slope\nfor failure (e.g. Stigall and Dugan, 2010). An external trigger, most\nlikely a climate-independent one such as an earthquake may then\nbe necessary to eventually cause failure. Hence, although pre-\nconditioned by a climate-controlled process, the landslide can\noccur at any time irrespective of sea level.\nRapid deposition may allow for, accommodate, or enhance other\nprocesses capable of destabilising a slope, such as ﬂuid ﬂow to areas\nof less rapid deposition where the corresponding effective stress\nreduction is more critical (Dugan and Flemings, 2000; Bryn et al.,\n2005; Leynaud et al., 2007). A delay time is necessary for the\nﬂuid migration to take place which mainly depends on the\npermeability of the sediment as well as the distance the ﬂuid has to\ntravel, and may involve several thousand to a million years (Dugan\nand Flemings, 2000; Dugan, 2012). This may explain the observed\nvariations in delay times between the onset of rapid deposition and\nthe timing of the failure (Table 4) and supports reason (III) dis-\ncussed above. 2D numerical modelling of excess pore pressure\ngeneration due to ﬂuid ﬂow for well-constrained case studies as for\nthe Storegga slide (Leynaud et al., 2007) and the New Jersey con-\ntinental margin (Dugan and Flemings, 2000) can help to test this\nhypothesis.",

This data\nbase is the most comprehensive one to date and is the only one\nconsidering uncertainty intervals to the age estimates, and to\ninclude changes in local sedimentation rates.\nBased on this data set we do not ﬁnd statistical evidence for a\nclimate control on the timing of large submarine landslides, as\nthese resemble a Poisson distribution in which events are essen-\ntially random. One reason could be that the sample size is too small\nand/or the forcing too weak to be statistically signiﬁcant. Another\nexplanation is that the impact of climate on factors promoting slope\ninstability is not uniform and margins respond differently to an\nexternal climate forcing, thus resulting in an inconsistent signal. For\nexample ﬂuid ﬂow within the slope may act as an important factor\ncontrolling the timing of failure. However, there does not appear to\nbe a very strong linkage between sea level and landslide frequency.\nA time lag of several kiloyears between periods of rapid depo-\nsition and slope failure implies that in most cases rapid deposition\ndoes not immediately trigger failure. Rapid deposition may well\nweaken the slope due to excess pore pressures locked in low\npermeable sediment, or due to ﬂuid migration within layers of high\npermeability towards areas far away from the excess pore pressure\ninitiation area.\nAbout half of the landslides in the data base have uncertainties\nthat are too large to attribute them to a particular sea level stand.
