High overpressures are present within low permeability mudstones where there have been\nmultiple, very large, submarine landslides during the Pleistocene. Beneath 200 mbsf at Site U1324, pore pressures drop significantly: there are no\nsubmarine landslides in this mixture of mudstone, siltstone, and sandstone. The penetrometer measurements did not reach the in situ pressure at\nthe end of the deployment. We used a soil model to determine that an extrapolation approach based on the inverse of square route of time (1=\nﬃt\np )\nrequires much less decay time to achieve a desirable accuracy than an inverse time (1/t) extrapolation. Expedition 308 examined how rapid and\nasymmetric sedimentation above a permeable aquifer drives lateral fluid flow, extreme pore pressures, and submarine landslides. We interpret that\nthe high overpressures observed are driven by rapid sedimentation of low permeability material from the ancestral Mississippi River. Reduced\noverpressure at depth at Site U1324 suggests lateral flow (drainage) whereas high overpressure at Site U1322 requires inflow from below: lateral\nflow in the underlying permeable aquifer provides one mechanism for these observations. High overpressure near the seafloor reduces slope\nstability and provides a mechanism for the large submarine landslides and low regional gradient (2°) offshore from the Mississippi delta.\n© 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Resistivity also increases with decreasing porosity at\nSite U1322 (Fig. 4D).\nPorosity and resistivity are low within mass transport\ndeposits (purple lithologic units, Figs. 3B and 4B). The most\nstriking example of this is between 91 and 125 mbsf at Site\nU1322 (Fig. 4D and E) where porosity declines to the base of\nthe mass transport deposit and then jumps abruptly by 5\nporosity units. The densification of mass transport deposits\nrelative to their bounding sediments is attributed to the effect of\nshearing on the soil (Piper et al., 1984; Prior et al., 1984; Dugan\net al., 2007; Sawyer et al., 2007).",

(in\nreview-a) describe the details of each deployment and how the\ntools were calibrated.\nIn an ideal, ‘Type I’, deployment, the pressure peaks during\ninsertion and subsequently declines with time (Fig. 6A). Dis-\nsipation times ranged from 25 to 93 min with an average\nduration of approximately 60 min (Table 1, Supplementary\ndata). The T2P shaft pressure declines more slowly and is much\nhigher than the tip pressure at the end of the deployment\n(Fig. 6). Because the shaft has a much larger diameter than the\ntip, it deforms a larger region around the probe: the elevated\npressure due to the shaft deformation takes more time to\ndissipate. The T2P and DVTPP deployments were in very\nsimilar lithologies, yet the degree of dissipation in the DVTPP is\nless than that of the T2P tip (Fig. 6A). This is also due to the\ngeometry of the penetrometers. The DVTPP tip is significantly\nlarger than that of the T2P and it tapers to become even thicker\nbehind the tip (Fig. 5); as a result, it disturbs a greater region\naround the penetrometer than does the T2P tip and its\ndissipation time is greater. Long et al. (2007) compare the\nDVTPP and the T2P geometries and their consequent behavior\nduring insertion and dissipation.\nThe penetrometer is pushed into the formation with the drill\nstring and then the drill string is immediately raised to decouple\nthe penetrometer from the effects of ship heave. During many\ndeployments, the penetrometer was slightly dislodged when the\ndrill string was raised (Fig. 6B). In this situation, the measured\npressure drops abruptly when the bit is raised (a ‘Type II’",

The inverse time approach is most often\nused (1/t, where t=dissipation time) (Davis et al., 1991; Fang\net al., 1993; Urgeles et al., 2000). In this technique, the data are\nplotted on an inverse time scale and a linear extrapolation is\nmade based on the gradient of the last part of the data (Fig. 7B).\nUnfortunately, there is no theoretical foundation to this\napproach. Laboratory calibration chamber tests suggest that 1/t\nextrapolation provides an accurate estimate of in situ pressure\n(Lim et al., 2006).

Above 200 mbsf, overpressures equal approxi-\nmately 70% of the hydrostatic effective stress (λ⁎=0.7)\n(Fig. 3F). These observations are compatible with pre-conso-\nlidation stresses determined from uniaxial consolidation\nmeasurements (Long, 2007; Long et al., in review-b). Beneath\n200 mbsf, overpressures drop sharply and are approximately\nequal to 1 MPa. Sample deformation at these deeper depths\nresults in ambiguous pre-consolidation stresses (Long, 2007;\nLong et al., in review-b). Down hole pressures measured while\ndrilling varied between 1.2 and 1.4 MPa beneath 400 mbsf\n(“PWD”, Fig. 3). When sands were penetrated, pressures\ndropped relative to when mudstones were penetrated. We\ninterpret that this records flow from the borehole into the\npermeable formation (circulation loss) and that the downhole\npressures are an upper bound to the formation pressure. The\nmudstone porosity beneath 200 mbsf declines slowly but\ncontinuously with depth (Fig. 3).

T2P #24 (200 mbsf)\nand DVTPP #18 (220 mbsf) are good measurements and we\nhave drawn a straight line from near the seafloor through these\ndata. The intervening data points all scatter around λ⁎=0.6. The\nmajority of these measurements are either Type IIB or only shaft\npressures were recorded (Table 1); we do not have enough\nconfidence to interpret these data in more detail. Pre-\nconsolidation stresses determined from uniaxial consolidation\nmeasurements were made to a depth of 210 mbsf and suggest\nλ⁎=0.6−0.7 (Long, 2007; Long et al., in review-b). Our results\nare also similar to those presented by Ostermeier et al. (2000),\nwho reported a linear overpressure gradient with λ⁎=0.5 at the\nUrsa Platform 10 km to the north of Site U1322 (Fig. 1). The\ndeepest measurement (DVTPP #19) is of high quality yet has an\nanomalously low pressure (0.25 MPa), which is contrary to the\ngeneral trend of increasing overpressure with depth. We explore\nthis further in the ensuing section.\nAt Site U1323, which is 5 km to the east of Site U1322\n(Fig. 2), we encountered an overpressured and permeable\nformation that flowed water and unconsolidated sand into the\nborehole at 200 mbsf (Flemings et al., 2006a). This resulted in\nan increase in bottom hole pressure of 1.0 MPa. Ostermeier\net al. (2002) suggest that the increase in hole pressure due to\nthese flows can approximate the downhole pressure encoun-\ntered and we note that 1 MPa overpressure is very similar to the\npenetrometer derived pressures (‘star’ in Fig. 4).",

The interbedded silts and sands\nbeneath 300 mbsf have a significantly higher hydraulic\ndiffusivity than the overlying mudstones and as a result, there\nis not a significant overpressure gradient in this zone.\nAt Site U1324, the overpressure beneath 200 mbsf is less\nthan the overpressure above (Fig. 3F). Given one-dimensional\nflow, flow is driven down the overpressure gradient; thus there\nis downward flow from the overpressured section above\n200 mbsf. However, one-dimensional sedimentation of homo-\ngenous material where flow exits only at the seafloor generates\noverpressures that increase with depth (Fig. 11, Supplementary\ndata). Thus, there must be some flow pathway that drains the\nlower section relative to the upper section. An obvious\ncandidate is lateral flow along the permeable silts, sands within\nthe drilled section, or lateral flow in the underlying Blue Unit\n(e.g. Dugan and Flemings, 2000).\nAt Site U1322, where only mudstone is deposited and the\naverage sedimentation rate is much lower than at Site U1324,\nTg equals 1.0 (Table 2, Supplementary data). This results in\na basal value of λ⁎ less than 0.3, which is much less than the\noverpressures observed at Site U1322 (λ⁎=0.6) (Fig. 11B,\nSupplementary data). To account for the high overpressures\nat Site U1322, there must be a basal source of fluid: the\nobvious candidate is the underlying permeable sands of the Blue\nUnit.\nThe low overpressure recorded by DVTPP #19 at 238 mbsf,\nnear the base of Site U1322 (Fig. 4F, Table 1, Supplementary\ndata) is our most perplexing measurement. Our present\ninterpretation is that the low pressure measured with a single\npenetrometer measurement at the base of the hole is caused by\npenetration and drainage of fluid from an upper isolated\ncompartment of the Blue Unit that was penetrated during\nindustry drilling. Ostermeier et al. (2000) made penetrometer\nmeasurements in 1991 at the Ursa Platform 10 km to the north\n(Fig. 1) and they did do not report any decline in overpressure as\nthe Blue Unit was approached. Since that time, many wells have\npenetrated the Blue Sand and significant volumes of water and\nunconsolidated sand were expelled at the sea floor (Alberty,\n2000). An important example is the MC-810-1 well, drilled in\n1995, which had large volumes of flow to the surface and was\nlocated less than 1 km to the south of Site U1322 (Fig. 1). Given\npressure diffusivities for siltstone and mudstone of 2×10−7 to\n10−8 m2/s (Table 2, Supplementary data), and 15 years since\ndrilling, 10% of an instantaneous pressure drop present in the\nBlue Unit sandstone will have penetrated a distance of 4.6–\n16.2 m into the mudstone, respectively (Turcotte and Schubert,\n1982). Based on seismic data, we estimate that Site U1322 was\ndrilled to 20 m above the Blue Unit; however, we do not know\nthe lithology.",

We interpret\nthat the high overpressures observed are driven by rapid sedi-\nmentation of low permeability material from the ancestral\nMississippi River.
