The\nneural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists\nof ﬁve convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers,\nand three fully-connected layers with a ﬁnal 1000-way softmax. To make train-\ning faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efﬁcient GPU implemen-\ntation of the convolution operation. To reduce overﬁtting in the fully-connected\nlayers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout”\nthat proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the\nILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%,\ncompared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.",

To im-\nprove their performance, we can collect larger datasets, learn more powerful models, and use bet-\nter techniques for preventing overﬁtting. Until recently, datasets of labeled images were relatively\nsmall — on the order of tens of thousands of images (e.g., NORB [16], Caltech-101/256 [8, 9], and\nCIFAR-10/100 [12]). Simple recognition tasks can be solved quite well with datasets of this size,\nespecially if they are augmented with label-preserving transformations. For example, the current-\nbest error rate on the MNIST digit-recognition task (<0.3%) approaches human performance [4].\nBut objects in realistic settings exhibit considerable variability, so to learn to recognize them it is\nnecessary to use much larger training sets. And indeed, the shortcomings of small image datasets\nhave been widely recognized (e.g., Pinto et al. [21]), but it has only recently become possible to col-\nlect labeled datasets with millions of images. The new larger datasets include LabelMe [23], which\nconsists of hundreds of thousands of fully-segmented images, and ImageNet [6], which consists of\nover 15 million labeled high-resolution images in over 22,000 categories.",

To be more precise, a pooling layer can be thought of as consisting of a grid of pooling\nunits spaced s pixels apart, each summarizing a neighborhood of size z × z centered at the location\nof the pooling unit. If we set s = z, we obtain traditional local pooling as commonly employed\nin CNNs. If we set s < z, we obtain overlapping pooling. This is what we use throughout our\nnetwork, with s = 2 and z = 3. This scheme reduces the top-1 and top-5 error rates by 0.4% and\n0.3%, respectively, as compared with the non-overlapping scheme s = 2, z = 2, which produces\noutput of equivalent dimensions.

The recently-introduced technique, called “dropout” [10], consists\nof setting to zero the output of each hidden neuron with probability 0.5. The neurons which are\n“dropped out” in this way do not contribute to the forward pass and do not participate in back-\npropagation. So every time an input is presented, the neural network samples a different architecture,\nbut all these architectures share weights. This technique reduces complex co-adaptations of neurons,\nsince a neuron cannot rely on the presence of particular other neurons. It is, therefore, forced to\nlearn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of the\nother neurons.
