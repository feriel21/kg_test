An Automated Pipeline for Geological Knowledge Extraction and Interpretation

This repository provides a complete end-to-end pipeline for constructing a Geoscience-Aware Knowledge Graph from scientific articles related to Mass-Transport Deposits (MTDs).

It enables any researcher to run the process on their own PDFs and automatically generate:

Clean structured text extracted from PDF articles

Domain keyword discovery using AI + expert priors

Auto-generated geological configuration file

Semantic analytics (PMI heatmap, frequency plots)

Scientific SVO (Subject–Verb–Object) triplets

Normalized geological entities using SBERT

A cleaned, ontology-aware knowledge graph

High-quality graph visualizations

Exported geological facts for interpretation and ML

Full Pipeline Overview

You can run the entire workflow using:

bash run_all.sh


This script executes all modules in the correct order and produces all outputs inside output_json/ and output_graph/.

🧩 Pipeline Steps
Step	Script	Description
0	ingest_pdf.py	Extracts structured text blocks from PDF files

1	0_discover_domain_v2.py	AI-based geological domain discovery (TF-IDF, RAKE, PMI, embeddings)

2	1_auto_update_config.py	Generates domain_config.py based on discovered + expert terms

3	2_visualize_analytics.py	Produces PMI heatmap & frequency barplot for conceptual analysis

4	3_extract_advanced.py	Scientific SVO triplet extraction

5	4_normalize_gpu.py	SBERT normalization of geological entities

6	4.1_clean_graph_full.py	Structural + semantic cleaning of the knowledge graph

7	4.2_semantic_enrichment.py	Adds ontology classes and semantic relations

8	5_visualize_graph.py	Full high-quality graph visualizations

🔍 Key Features
✔ Automated Domain Discovery

Combines TF-IDF, RAKE, PMI, and Sentence-BERT clustering.

✔ Knowledge-Infused Rules

Expert keywords + auto-learned concepts.

✔ Scientific SVO Extraction

Detects key geological relations like:

“fluid overpressure triggers slope failure”

“slumps occur on continental margins”

✔ Entity Normalization

Aggregates synonyms (e.g., slumps, slumping, slump block → slump).

✔ Graph Cleaning

Removes noise like one, they, value, area, etc.

✔ Ontology-Aware Enrichment

Nodes classified as:

PROCESS

LOCATION

MATERIAL

FACIES

FEATURE

TRIGGER

Edges refined (CAUSES, LOCATED_IN, FORMS, EXHIBITS…).

✔ High-Quality Visualizations

Includes:

Louvain communities

Degree-scaled nodes

Top-200 labeled concepts

Degree distribution

Global overview

📊 Semantic Analytics Outputs

Generated by 2_visualize_analytics.py:

PPMI Heatmap: strongest conceptual co-occurrences

Concept Frequency Plot: most dominant geological terms

These visualizations support geological interpretation and model explainability.

📡 Graph Outputs

Located in output_graph/:

final_graph_clean_full.gexf (after cleaning)

final_graph_knowledge_layer.gexf (ontology-enriched)

geological_facts.csv (triplets + semantic classes)

PNG visualizations in output_graph/visuals/

All graphs are fully compatible with Gephi, Cytoscape, NetworkX, and Neo4j.
